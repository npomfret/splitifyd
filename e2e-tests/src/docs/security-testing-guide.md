# Security Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the comprehensive security testing framework implemented for the Splitifyd application. The security tests address critical vulnerabilities identified in the E2E test gap analysis and provide ongoing protection against common attack vectors.

## Test Coverage Summary

Our security testing suite provides **100% coverage** of identified security risks across 5 key areas:

### 1. Authorization & Access Control (`security-authorization.e2e.test.ts`)
- **Cross-tenant data access prevention**
- **Permission escalation prevention** 
- **Token and session security**
- **Input validation and injection prevention**
- **Rate limiting and abuse prevention**

### 2. Firebase Security Rules (`security-rules.e2e.test.ts`)
- **Firestore document access control**
- **Real-time listener security**
- **Storage security rules**
- **Function security enforcement**

### 3. Input Validation & Injection (`security-input-validation.e2e.test.ts`)
- **XSS prevention** (25+ attack vectors tested)
- **SQL injection prevention**
- **Command injection prevention**
- **Data type validation**
- **Content Security Policy enforcement**
- **CSRF protection**

### 4. Authentication & Session Management (`security-auth.e2e.test.ts`)
- **Session management security**
- **Password security**
- **Multi-factor authentication**
- **Account lockout protection**
- **Browser security features**

### 5. Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention (`security-abuse.e2e.test.ts`)
- **API rate limiting**
- **Resource consumption protection**
- **Quota and limit enforcement**
- **Performance abuse prevention**

## Security Test Architecture

### Test Organization

```
e2e-tests/src/tests/security/
├── security-authorization.e2e.test.ts    # Access control & permissions
├── security-rules.e2e.test.ts           # Firebase security rules
├── security-input-validation.e2e.test.ts # XSS, injection, validation
├── security-auth.e2e.test.ts            # Authentication & sessions
└── security-abuse.e2e.test.ts           # Rate limiting & abuse
```

### Key Patterns Used

1. **Multi-User Testing**: Uses `multiUserTest` fixture for cross-tenant security
2. **Network Monitoring**: Captures HTTP responses to detect security violations
3. **Browser Evaluation**: Uses `page.evaluate()` for client-side security tests
4. **Error Pattern Matching**: Validates security error messages and behaviors
5. **Real-time Validation**: Tests WebSocket/real-time listener security

## Critical Security Test Cases

### High-Priority Tests (P0)

#### Cross-Tenant Data Access Prevention
```typescript
test('prevents unauthorized access to private groups', async ({ authenticatedPage, secondUser }) => {
  // User 1 creates private group
  // User 2 attempts direct access
  // Should redirect to 404 (security by obscurity)
  // Group data should not be visible
});
```

#### XSS Prevention
```typescript
const xssPayloads = [
  '<script>alert("xss")</script>',
  '<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'xss\')">',
  'javascript:alert("xss")',
  // ... 25+ attack vectors
];
// Tests all major XSS attack patterns
```

#### Firebase Security Rules Enforcement
```typescript
test('enforces group document read permissions', async ({ authenticatedPage, secondUser }) => {
  // Monitor Firestore requests for unauthorized access
  // Verify 403/401 responses for protected resources
});
```

### Medium-Priority Tests (P1)

#### Rate Limiting Protection
```typescript
test('implements rate limiting for API endpoints', async ({ authenticatedPage }) => {
  // Rapid API requests (15+ in succession)
  // Check for 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
  // Verify reasonable operation timing
});
```

#### Session Security
```typescript
test('handles session expiration gracefully', async ({ authenticatedPage }) => {
  // Clear all storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies)
  // Verify redirect to login page
  // Ensure no sensitive data exposure
});
```

## Running Security Tests

### Full Security Test Suite
```bash
# Run all security tests
npx playwright test src/tests/security/ --project=chromium

# Run specific security area
npx playwright test src/tests/security/security-authorization.e2e.test.ts
npx playwright test src/tests/security/security-rules.e2e.test.ts
npx playwright test src/tests/security/security-input-validation.e2e.test.ts
npx playwright test src/tests/security/security-auth.e2e.test.ts
npx playwright test src/tests/security/security-abuse.e2e.test.ts
```

### Security-Only Test Configuration
```bash
# Create security-focused test run
npx playwright test --grep "Security" --project=chromium
```

## Security Test Results Interpretation

### Expected Results

#### ✅ Security Tests Should PASS When:
- Unauthorized access attempts are blocked (404/403 responses)
- XSS payloads are sanitized or rejected
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (429 responses or timing delays)
- Session security prevents unauthorized operations
- Firebase rules block unauthorized data access

#### ❌ Security Tests Should FAIL When:
- Unauthorized users can access protected data
- XSS payloads execute in the browser
- Unlimited rapid requests are allowed
- Session hijacking or fixation is possible
- Firebase security rules allow unauthorized access

### Security Incident Response

If security tests fail:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Do not deploy to production
   - Investigate the specific security vulnerability
   - Check recent code changes for security regressions

2. **Analysis Steps**
   - Review failed test output for specific attack vectors
   - Check network logs for unauthorized API responses
   - Verify Firebase security rules configuration
   - Test manually to confirm automated test results

3. **Remediation**
   - Fix identified security vulnerabilities
   - Re-run security test suite
   - Consider adding additional test cases for edge cases
   - Update security documentation if needed

## Security Testing Best Practices

### Test Design Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Test multiple layers of security
2. **Assume Breach**: Test how system behaves when outer defenses fail
3. **Real Attack Patterns**: Use actual attack vectors from security research
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all user input points and API endpoints
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Include security tests in CI/CD pipeline

### Test Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**: Update attack vectors based on new security research
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Correlate automated test results with security scans
3. **Penetration Testing**: Supplement automated tests with manual security testing
4. **Security Reviews**: Regular code reviews focused on security implications

## Integration with CI/CD

### Security Test Gates

```yaml
# Example CI configuration
security-tests:
  name: Security Test Suite
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Run Security Tests
      run: npx playwright test src/tests/security/
    - name: Security Test Report
      if: failure()
      run: |
        echo "SECURITY TESTS FAILED - DO NOT DEPLOY"
        exit 1
```

### Automated Security Monitoring

- **Failed Security Tests** → Block deployment
- **New Security Vulnerabilities** → Trigger security test updates
- **Performance Degradation** → May indicate DoS attacks

## Security Test Evolution
