# Review

Analyse the current change list from a fresh perspective, and critique it. 

Check for new files that have not been added to git. Either add them or make sure they are ignored.

Find and use the `.md` files in the project for guidance.

Don't be pedantic, if it's mostly ok just say so.  Focus on important stuff like:

 * obvious bugs
 * security blunders
 * performance or scalability bottlenecks
