# Commit

First read all the files in @docs/guides

Use the git cli to view and analyse this **entier** changeset.

Have we violated any of the rules or patterns?

If not, compose a detailed commit message, do not commit the code.

Check the untracked files and either add them to git, or delete them.  In special cases new some files should be ignored - but always ask first.
