# Commit Message

First:
- [ ] read all the (`.md`) files in `docs/guides/*`

Next:
- [ ] use the git cli to view and analyse this changeset. ALL OF IT, every single changed file. No exceptions.
- [ ] **check every change in every file**
- [ ] have we violated any of the rules, or deviated from the patterns? If so: **STOP HERE**

If it's ok:
- [ ] compose a detailed commit message (**do not commit the code**), but do not list out EVERY change
- [ ] there should be no untracked files. Either:
    - if they are needed: add them to git
    - otherwise: delete them
    - in special cases new some files should be _git ignored_ - but always ask first

Report your commit message. Stop.
