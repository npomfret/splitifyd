# Commit

- [ ] read all the files in @docs/guides
- [ ] use the git cli to view and analyse this **entier** changeset
- [ ] have we violated any of the rules or patterns? if so: **STOP**

If it's ok:

- [ ] compose a detailed commit message (**do not commit the code**), but do not list out EVERY change
- [ ] there should be no untracked files. Either:
  - if they are needed: add them to git
  - otherwise: delete them
  - in special cases new some files should be _git ignored_ - but always ask first
