> The full test suite is very slow.  Be smart: find and pick out the tests that need running based on your changes. The firebase integration tests are particularly useful.

- [ ] you **MUST** read docs/guides/*.md
- [ ] inspcet your changes, and search for test cases
- [ ] run appropriate **individual** test cases

Do they fail?  If so... why? 

* Is the code broken?
* Is the test correct?
* Can / should the test be deleted or re-written?
* Are there tests missing?
