            <h2>Preamble and Irrevocable Assent</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding, non-negotiable, and perpetually enforceable agreement between You ("the User," "Your") and Splitifyd ("the Application," "We," "Us," or "Our"), a proprietary software solution developed and maintained by the Sole Proprietor ("the Developer"). By accessing, utilizing, or otherwise interacting with any facet of the Application, including but not limited to its interfaces, functionalities, content, or associated services, You hereby signify Your absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable assent to these Terms in their entirety. This assent is deemed to have occurred at the precise moment of Your initial engagement with the Application and shall remain in full force and effect for the maximum duration permissible by law, irrespective of Your continued active use. Should You harbor any reservations, objections, or dissent concerning any provision contained herein, Your singular and unappealable recourse is the immediate, permanent, and complete cessation of all interaction with the Application, accompanied by the forfeiture of any and all accrued benefits, data, or privileges.</p>

            <h2>Grant of License: Revocable and Non-Transferable</h2>
            <p>Subject to Your strict and continuous adherence to these Terms, the Developer grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and fully revocable license to access and utilize the Application solely for Your personal, non-commercial purposes. This license is expressly contingent upon Your acknowledgment that the Application, including all intellectual property rights inherent therein (e.g., copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets), remains the exclusive and perpetual property of the Developer. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as conferring upon You any ownership interest, title, or proprietary right in the Application or any of its components. The Developer reserves the unfettered right to terminate or suspend this license, or Your access to the Application, at any time, for any reason or no reason, without prior notice, liability, or obligation to provide explanation or compensation.</p>

            <p>You covenant and warrant that Your use of the Application shall strictly conform to all applicable laws, regulations, and these Terms. You are expressly prohibited from, and agree not to, engage in any conduct that: (a) infringes upon the intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights of the Developer or any third party; (b) involves the unauthorized access, modification, disruption, or interference with the Application's operation, servers, or networks; (c) constitutes the transmission of malicious code, viruses, or other harmful components; (d) involves the collection, harvesting, or aggregation of data from the Application without explicit written consent from the Developer; (e) is defamatory, obscene, offensive, or otherwise objectionable; (f) constitutes unsolicited commercial communications (spam); or (g) attempts to circumvent any security measures or technological protections implemented by the Developer.

        <section>
            <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties: As-Is, Where-Is</h2>
            <p>THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, THE DEVELOPER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR THAT THE APPLICATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE APPLICATION WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK AND DISCRETION. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE DEVELOPER OR THROUGH THE APPLICATION SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Limitation of Liability: Absolute and Comprehensive</h2>
            <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPER, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF THE DEVELOPER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH: (A) YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION; (B) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION, OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE APPLICATION; (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (D) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE APPLICATION; OR (E) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE APPLICATION. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLIES REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY ASSERTED, INCLUDING WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Indemnification: Your Sole Responsibility</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Developer, its affiliates, licensors, service providers, employees, agents, officers, and directors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to Your violation of these Terms or Your use of the Application, including, but not limited to, Your content submissions, any use of the Application's content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms, or Your use of any information obtained from the Application. This indemnification obligation shall survive the termination of these Terms and Your use of the Application.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Modifications to Terms: Unilateral and Binding</h2>
            <p>The Developer reserves the absolute and unfettered right to modify, amend, or replace these Terms at any time, in its sole and absolute discretion, without prior notice or Your consent. Any such modifications shall become effective immediately upon their posting within the Application or on any associated platform. Your continued use of the Application subsequent to the posting of revised Terms shall constitute Your unequivocal and binding acceptance of such revisions. It is Your sole responsibility to periodically review these Terms to remain apprised of any changes. Should You object to any modifications, Your only recourse is to immediately cease all use of the Application.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution: Developer's Choice</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction exclusively chosen by the Developer, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the Application shall be instituted exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the aforementioned jurisdiction. You hereby waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over You by such courts and to venue in such courts. You further agree to waive any right to a jury trial and to participate in any class action or representative proceeding against the Developer.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Miscellaneous Provisions: Developer's Advantage</h2>
            <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between You and the Developer regarding the Application and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral. The Developer's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect. The Developer may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to You. You may not assign Your rights or obligations under these Terms without the Developer's prior written consent.</p>
