# Incomplete Group Membership Verification

## Problem
- **Location**: `firebase/functions/src/expenses/handlers.ts:42-62` (verifyGroupMembership)
- **Description**: The `verifyGroupMembership` function currently only checks if the user is the *owner* of the group document (`groupData.userId !== userId`). The comment `// In the future, we'd check groupData.data.members array` indicates that this is an incomplete implementation. This means that only the creator of a group can add/manage expenses for that group, which is likely not the intended behavior for a shared expense application. This is a functional limitation and potentially a bug if users expect to collaborate on expenses within a group they are a member of, but not necessarily the creator.
- **Current vs Expected**: Currently, only the group creator can perform actions related to group expenses. Expected behavior is that any member of a group should be able to perform actions (e.g., add expenses) within that group, assuming appropriate permissions.

## Solution
- Modify the `verifyGroupMembership` function to check the `groupData.data.members` array (if it exists) for the `userId`.
- If the `members` array is not yet implemented, this issue should be linked to a broader feature request for proper group membership management.
- Ensure that the `groupData.data.members` array is populated correctly when groups are created or updated.

## Impact
- **Type**: Behavior change (feature limitation/bug fix)
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Complexity**: Moderate
- **Benefit**: High value (enables core collaborative functionality, improves user experience)

## Implementation Notes
- This change will require understanding how `groupData.data.members` is intended to be structured and populated.
- Consider the implications for existing data if the `members` array is not currently in use.
