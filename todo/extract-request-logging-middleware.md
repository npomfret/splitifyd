# Extract Request Logging to a Dedicated Middleware

**Problem**: The request logging logic in `firebase/functions/src/utils/middleware.ts` is currently defined inline within the `applyStandardMiddleware` function. This makes the `applyStandardMiddleware` function more complex than necessary, as it mixes the application of middleware with the definition of a specific middleware's behavior. This also makes the logging logic harder to reuse or test independently from the main middleware application function.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/utils/middleware.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Create a New Middleware Function**: Extract the request logging logic into a new, dedicated middleware function (e.g., `requestLogger`). This function should encapsulate the logic for logging incoming requests and their responses.
2. **Use the New Middleware**: Replace the inline logging logic in `applyStandardMiddleware` with a call to the new `requestLogger` middleware. This will make `applyStandardMiddleware` cleaner and more focused on its role of applying a stack of middleware.
3. **Export the New Middleware**: Export `requestLogger` so it can be imported and used independently if needed for specific routes or testing scenarios.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the code will be better organized, more modular, and easier to test.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are localized to the logging logic and are unlikely to have any side effects, as long as the extracted logic behaves identically.

**Complexity**: Low. This is a straightforward refactoring that involves extracting a block of code into a new function and updating a function call.

**Benefit**: Medium. This change will improve the modularity and testability of the request logging logic, making the `applyStandardMiddleware` function more readable and maintainable.
