# Re-evaluate Password Validation Strictness

**Problem**: The password validation in `webapp/js/auth.js` is currently very strict, requiring uppercase, lowercase, a number, and a special character. While strong passwords are good for security, overly strict requirements can lead to a poor user experience, increased abandonment rates during registration, and users resorting to easily guessable patterns or writing down their passwords (e.g., `Password1!`). This can inadvertently reduce overall security.

**File**: `webapp/js/auth.js`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Balance Security and Usability**: Re-evaluate the password requirements to strike a better balance between security and usability. Consider industry best practices, such as NIST guidelines, which often prioritize password length over complexity. For example, a passphrase of 12+ characters might be more secure and easier to remember than an 8-character complex password.
2. **Provide Clear Feedback**: If certain requirements are kept, provide clear, real-time feedback to the user as they type their password, indicating which requirements are met and which are still missing. This guides the user without frustrating them.
3. **Consider Alternatives**: Explore alternatives or enhancements like passwordless authentication (e.g., magic links, WebAuthn) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security without solely burdening the user with complex password rules.
4. **Backend Enforcement**: Ensure that any password policy changes are also reflected and enforced on the backend to prevent bypasses.

**Behavior Change**: This is a behavior change. The password validation rules will be relaxed, which may affect the security of user accounts if not balanced with other measures. However, the goal is to improve overall security by encouraging better user behavior.

**Risk**: Medium. Relaxing password requirements can potentially decrease security if not balanced with other measures (e.g., MFA, breach detection). Careful consideration and security review are necessary.

**Complexity**: Low. This change primarily involves modifying the password validation regex and associated error messages in the frontend. Backend changes might also be needed.

**Benefit**: High. This change will significantly improve user experience, reduce friction during registration and login, and potentially lead to users choosing more memorable (and thus, less likely to be written down) passwords.
