# Implement Group Activity Timeline

**Problem**: The `loadGroupActivity` function in `webapp/js/group-detail.js` currently throws an error indicating that the activity timeline is "not implemented." This is a significant missing feature that would provide users with a chronological view of all events within a group, such as expense creations, updates, deletions, and settlements. Without this, users lack a comprehensive history of group financial activities.

**File**: `webapp/js/group-detail.js`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Define Activity Data Structure**: Determine what constitutes an "activity" and define a clear data structure for storing activity events. This might include fields like `type` (e.g., 'expense_created', 'expense_updated', 'settlement'), `timestamp`, `userId` (who performed the action), and `details` (contextual information like expense ID, amount, description changes).
2. **Backend Endpoint**: Create a new backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/groups/:groupId/activity`) to fetch activity data for a given group. This endpoint should query a new 'activities' collection or aggregate data from existing collections (expenses, settlements).
3. **Implement Frontend Logic**: Implement the `loadGroupActivity` function to fetch data from the new backend endpoint. This function should then render the data in a chronological timeline format, displaying each activity event clearly to the user.
4. **Populate Activity Data**: Ensure that relevant actions (creating/updating/deleting expenses, settling debts) on the backend generate corresponding activity records.

**Behavior Change**: This is a new feature. It introduces new functionality to the application without altering existing behaviors.

**Risk**: Medium. This change requires both backend development (new data model, new endpoint) and frontend implementation. Careful design is needed to ensure activity data is comprehensive and efficiently queried.

**Complexity**: Medium. This change involves implementing a new feature with both backend and frontend components, including data modeling, API development, and UI rendering.

**Benefit**: High. This feature will significantly improve the usability and transparency of the application by providing users with a clear, auditable history of group financial activities, enhancing trust and understanding.
