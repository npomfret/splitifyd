# Replace Manual Validation with Joi in Expense Validation

**Problem**: The `validateCreateExpense` and `validateUpdateExpense` functions in `firebase/functions/src/expenses/validation.ts` currently use a series of manual `if` statements and conditional checks for input validation. This approach is:
- **Verbose and Repetitive**: Leads to a lot of boilerplate code for common validation rules.
- **Prone to Errors**: Easy to miss edge cases or introduce inconsistencies.
- **Hard to Read and Maintain**: Difficult to quickly grasp all validation rules for an endpoint.
- **Inconsistent**: Deviates from the project's existing use of Joi for validation in other areas (e.g., `documents/validation.ts`), leading to an inconsistent validation strategy.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/expenses/validation.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Adopt Joi for Expense Validation**: Replace the manual validation logic with Joi schemas for `CreateExpenseRequest` and `UpdateExpenseRequest`. This will centralize and standardize validation rules.
2. **Define Clear Schemas**: Create Joi schemas that precisely define the expected structure, data types, constraints (e.g., `amount.min(0)`, `description.trim().required()`), and relationships between fields for expense objects.
3. **Leverage Joi's Error Handling**: Use Joi's built-in error handling to return consistent and detailed error messages, which can then be processed by the centralized error handling middleware.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the validation logic will be more concise, readable, and maintainable.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are localized to the validation functions. The primary risk is ensuring that the new Joi schemas accurately reflect all existing validation rules and do not introduce any regressions. Thorough testing is crucial.

**Complexity**: Medium. This change involves rewriting the validation logic using Joi, which requires careful mapping of existing rules to Joi's syntax and understanding of Joi's features.

**Benefit**: High. This change will significantly improve the readability, maintainability, and consistency of the expense validation logic. It will also make it easier to add new validation rules, modify existing ones, and ensure data integrity in the future.
