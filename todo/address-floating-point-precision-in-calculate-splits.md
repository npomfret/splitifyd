# Address Floating-Point Precision in calculateSplits

**Problem**: The `calculateSplits` function in `firebase/functions/src/expenses/validation.ts` performs calculations with floating-point numbers (e.g., `amount / participants.length`, `amount * (split.percentage || 0) / 100`). The use of `Math.round((value * 100) / 100)` is an attempt to mitigate floating-point precision issues, but it's not a robust solution for financial calculations and can still lead to inaccuracies. This is critical for a financial application where exactness is paramount.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/expenses/validation.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Use a Dedicated Library for Financial Calculations**: Implement a library like `decimal.js` or `big.js` for all financial calculations. These libraries provide arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic, eliminating floating-point errors inherent in JavaScript's `Number` type.
2. **Work with Integers (Cents)**: Alternatively, convert all monetary values to their smallest integer unit (e.g., cents) at the earliest possible point (e.g., upon receiving input) and perform all calculations using integers. Convert back to decimal for display purposes only. This avoids floating-point arithmetic altogether.
3. **Review Rounding Strategy**: Define a clear and consistent rounding strategy (e.g., round half up, round half to even) and apply it uniformly across the entire application, both frontend and backend, to prevent discrepancies.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the accuracy of financial calculations will be improved.

**Risk**: Medium. This change requires careful implementation to ensure that all financial calculations are handled correctly and that no new bugs are introduced. Thorough testing of all expense calculation scenarios is essential.

**Complexity**: Medium. This change involves introducing a new library or modifying the way monetary values are handled throughout the application, which might require changes in data storage if moving to integer cents.

**Benefit**: High. This change will significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of financial calculations, which is critical for a bill-splitting application, preventing potential financial discrepancies and user dissatisfaction.
