# Replace Inefficient Deep Cloning in sanitizeDocumentData

**Problem**: The `sanitizeDocumentData` function in `firebase/functions/src/documents/validation.ts` uses `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data))` to create a deep clone of the data object. This is a well-known inefficient and potentially problematic method for deep cloning, especially for large or complex objects. It has several limitations:
- **Performance**: It can be slow and memory-intensive for large objects.
- **Data Type Limitations**: It does not correctly handle all JavaScript data types (e.g., `Date` objects are converted to strings, `undefined` values are removed, functions are ignored, circular references cause errors).
- **Security**: While not directly a security vulnerability here, relying on `JSON.stringify` for complex data manipulation can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/documents/validation.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Use a Dedicated Deep Cloning Library**: Replace `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data))` with a more robust and performant deep cloning utility. Libraries like `lodash.cloneDeep` or `rfdc` (Really Fast Deep Clone) are specifically designed for this purpose and handle a wider range of data types correctly and efficiently.
2. **Install the Chosen Library**: Add the selected library as a dependency to the `firebase/functions/package.json` file.
3. **Update the Function**: Modify `sanitizeDocumentData` to use the new deep cloning utility. For example, `const sanitized = cloneDeep(data);`.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the performance and correctness of the deep cloning operation will be improved, especially for complex data structures.

**Risk**: Low. The change is localized to the `sanitizeDocumentData` function and involves replacing an inefficient method with a standard, reliable one. Provided the chosen cloning library is well-tested, the risk of introducing side effects is minimal.

**Complexity**: Low. This is a straightforward change involving replacing a single line of code and adding a new dependency.

**Benefit**: Medium. This change will improve the performance of data sanitization, reduce memory consumption, and ensure that all data types are cloned correctly, leading to more reliable and efficient processing of documents.
