# Remove Unnecessary Promise Caching in ApiService

**Problem**: The `_getBaseUrl` method in `webapp/js/api.js` uses a `_baseUrlPromise` to cache the result of `config.getApiUrl()`. However, `config.getApiUrl()` is a synchronous call that retrieves an already initialized value from `window.firebaseConfigManager.getConfig().apiUrl`. The use of a Promise here is unnecessary and adds an extra layer of asynchronous complexity where none is needed, making the code slightly harder to read and reason about.

**File**: `webapp/js/api.js`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Directly Access `config.getApiUrl()`**: Remove the `_baseUrlPromise` and directly call `config.getApiUrl()` when the base URL is needed. Since `config.getApiUrl()` is synchronous after `FirebaseConfigManager` is initialized, there's no need for a Promise wrapper.
2. **Ensure `config` is Ready**: Ensure that `config` (which refers to `window.firebaseConfigManager`) is guaranteed to be initialized before `ApiService` methods are called. This is already handled by `AppInit.initialize` and the `PageBuilder` pattern, which ensures Firebase is ready before page-specific scripts execute.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the `ApiService` will be simpler and more efficient by removing an unnecessary asynchronous abstraction.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are localized to the `_getBaseUrl` method and involve removing redundant code. As long as the `config.getApiUrl()` is indeed synchronous and reliably available when `_getBaseUrl` is called, the risk of side effects is minimal.

**Complexity**: Low. This is a straightforward refactoring that involves removing unnecessary Promise caching.

**Benefit**: Low. This change will simplify the `ApiService` code, making it slightly more readable and removing a minor performance overhead from unnecessary Promise creation and resolution.
