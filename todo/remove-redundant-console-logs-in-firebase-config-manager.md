# Remove Redundant Console Logs in FirebaseConfigManager

**Problem**: The `FirebaseConfigManager` in `webapp/js/firebase-config.js` contains several `console.log` statements that output information about fetching and loading Firebase configuration. While these logs are useful during initial development and debugging, they can clutter the browser console in production environments and do not provide structured logging for monitoring purposes. They also expose internal configuration details to the client.

**File**: `webapp/js/firebase-config.js`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Remove or Conditionally Log**: Remove the redundant `console.log` statements. If logging is still desired for debugging in development, consider wrapping them in a conditional check (e.g., `if (window.firebaseConfigManager.isLocalEnvironment()) { console.log(...) }`).
2. **Implement Structured Logging (Optional)**: For more advanced logging needs, consider implementing a structured logging solution that sends logs to a centralized service (e.g., Google Cloud Logging, Sentry). This would allow for better filtering, analysis, and alerting without cluttering the client's console.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the console output will be cleaner, especially in production environments.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are localized to the logging statements and are unlikely to have any side effects on application functionality. The primary risk is removing logs that might be unexpectedly relied upon for debugging.

**Complexity**: Low. This is a straightforward change that involves removing or conditionally wrapping `console.log` statements.

**Benefit**: Low. This change will improve the cleanliness of the browser console, especially in production environments, and reduce the exposure of internal configuration details.
