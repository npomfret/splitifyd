# Optimize and Refactor validateRequestStructure Middleware

**Problem**: The `validateRequestStructure` middleware in `firebase/functions/src/middleware/validation.ts` performs a recursive validation of the request body to check for depth, property count, and string length. After this, it stringifies the entire request body again (`JSON.stringify(req.body)`) solely to check for dangerous patterns using `checkForDangerousPatterns`. This re-stringification is inefficient and redundant, as the body has already been parsed into a JavaScript object.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/middleware/validation.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Integrate Dangerous Pattern Check**: Integrate the `checkForDangerousPatterns` logic directly into the recursive `validateObject` function. This way, strings are checked for dangerous patterns as they are traversed, avoiding the need to re-stringify the entire object. The check should be applied to string values within the object.
2. **Remove Redundant `JSON.stringify`**: Eliminate the `JSON.stringify(req.body)` call, as it's no longer needed after integrating the pattern check into the recursive validation.
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Ensure that errors thrown by `checkForDangerousPatterns` are caught and handled consistently with other validation errors (e.g., `Errors.INVALID_INPUT`).

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the performance of the `validateRequestStructure` middleware will be improved by eliminating redundant operations.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are localized to the `validateRequestStructure` function and involve optimizing an existing check. As long as the dangerous pattern detection logic is correctly moved, the risk of side effects is minimal.

**Complexity**: Medium. This change involves integrating the dangerous pattern check into the recursive validation logic, which requires careful modification of the traversal function.

**Benefit**: High. This change will improve the performance of the `validateRequestStructure` middleware by eliminating redundant operations, leading to faster request processing and reduced CPU usage.
