# Simplify or Remove toISOString Helper Function

**Problem**: The `toISOString` helper function in `firebase/functions/src/expenses/handlers.ts` is overly complex and largely redundant. Firestore `Timestamp` objects already have a `toDate()` method that returns a standard JavaScript `Date` object, and `Date` objects natively support `toISOString()`. The additional checks (`value instanceof Timestamp`, `value && typeof value.toDate === 'function'`) and type assertions (`as any`) add unnecessary complexity and verbosity.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/expenses/handlers.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Directly Use `toDate().toISOString()`**: In places where a Firestore `Timestamp` is converted, directly call `.toDate().toISOString()`. This is the standard and most straightforward way to convert a Firestore Timestamp to an ISO string.
2. **Directly Use `toISOString()`**: For JavaScript `Date` objects, directly call `.toISOString()`. No helper function is needed for this.
3. **Remove Redundant Function**: If all usages can be replaced with direct calls, remove the `toISOString` helper function entirely. This will clean up the codebase and reduce unnecessary abstractions.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the code will be cleaner, more idiomatic, and potentially slightly more efficient by removing an unnecessary function call.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are localized to the `toISOString` function and its call sites. As long as the direct conversions are correctly applied, the risk of introducing bugs is minimal.

**Complexity**: Low. This is a straightforward refactoring that involves simplifying date conversions and removing a redundant function.

**Benefit**: Medium. This change will improve code readability, reduce unnecessary function calls, and align the codebase with standard JavaScript and Firebase SDK practices.
