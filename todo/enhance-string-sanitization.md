# Enhance String Sanitization with a Dedicated Library

**Problem**: The `sanitizeString` function in `firebase/functions/src/utils/security.ts` currently uses simple regular expressions to remove dangerous patterns from strings. While this provides a basic level of sanitization, it is generally not robust enough to prevent all forms of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, especially when dealing with user-generated content that might contain complex HTML, SVG, or other executable content. Regex-based sanitization is notoriously difficult to get right and often has bypasses.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/utils/security.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Use a Dedicated HTML Sanitization Library**: Replace the custom regex-based sanitization with a well-maintained, security-audited, and widely-used HTML sanitization library, such as `dompurify` (for Node.js environments, it can be used with JSDOM). These libraries are designed to handle the complexities of HTML parsing and sanitization securely.
2. **Apply Sanitization Consistently**: Ensure that all user-generated content that is stored in the database, displayed in the frontend, or used in any context where it could be interpreted as executable code is passed through this robust sanitization process.
3. **Consider Contextual Escaping**: Beyond sanitization, implement contextual escaping (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML contexts, URL encoding for URL contexts) where appropriate to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

**Behavior Change**: This is a behavior change. The application will now use a more robust sanitization process. While the goal is to maintain existing functionality, there's a possibility that previously unsanitized (and potentially malicious) content might now be stripped or altered, which is the intended security improvement.

**Risk**: Medium. This change requires careful implementation and thorough testing to ensure that the new sanitization library does not inadvertently remove legitimate content or break existing application functionality. Compatibility with existing data should be verified.

**Complexity**: Medium. This change involves introducing a new library dependency, updating the sanitization logic, and potentially reviewing all points where user input is processed.

**Benefit**: High. This change will significantly improve the security of the application by providing a much stronger defense against XSS attacks, making the application more secure and trustworthy.
