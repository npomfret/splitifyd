# Plan for In-Browser Testing

## Objective
To implement robust in-browser end-to-end (E2E) testing for the Splitifyd web application to ensure critical user flows and UI interactions function as expected across different browsers.

## Recommended Technology
**Cypress**

### Why Cypress?
*   **Developer Experience:** Known for its ease of setup, fast execution, and excellent debugging capabilities directly within the browser.
*   **JavaScript-based:** Aligns with the existing JavaScript codebase, allowing for a consistent development experience.
*   **Real-time Reloading:** Provides immediate feedback during test development.
*   **Automatic Waiting:** Handles asynchronous operations automatically, reducing flakiness.
*   **Component and API Testing:** While primarily E2E, Cypress can also be used for component and API testing, offering a unified testing solution.

### Alternative Technology
**Playwright**

### Why Playwright?
*   **Cross-Browser Support:** Developed by Microsoft, it offers strong support for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari) from a single API.
*   **Fast and Reliable:** Designed for modern web applications, providing fast and reliable test execution.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Supports parallel test execution, which can speed up CI/CD pipelines.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Configuration
1.  **Install Cypress/Playwright:** Add the chosen framework as a development dependency to the `webapp/` project.
2.  **Initial Configuration:** Configure the testing framework to point to the local development server or a deployed staging environment.
3.  **Directory Structure:** Create a dedicated `webapp/tests/e2e/` directory for E2E tests.

### Phase 2: Core User Flow Testing
1.  **Login/Registration:** Write E2E tests for user registration and login processes.
2.  **Expense Management:** Develop tests for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting expenses.
3.  **Group Management:** Implement tests for creating, joining, and managing groups.
4.  **Navigation:** Ensure all primary navigation links and routes function correctly.

### Phase 3: Advanced Scenarios and Edge Cases
1.  **Error Handling:** Test various error scenarios (e.g., invalid input, network issues).
2.  **Permissions:** Verify that user permissions are correctly enforced.
3.  **Data Persistence:** Confirm that data changes are correctly persisted.
4.  **Responsive Design (Optional):** Explore testing the application's responsiveness on different screen sizes.

### Phase 4: Integration with CI/CD
1.  **Headless Testing:** Configure tests to run in headless mode for CI/CD environments.
2.  **Reporting:** Set up test reporting to generate clear and actionable results.
3.  **Automation:** Integrate E2E tests into the existing CI/CD pipeline to run on every pull request or deployment.

## Next Steps
1.  Confirm the chosen framework (Cypress or Playwright).
2.  Begin Phase 1: Setup and Basic Configuration.
3.  Prioritize core user flows for initial test development.
