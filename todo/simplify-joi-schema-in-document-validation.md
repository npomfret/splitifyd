# Simplify Complex Joi Schema in Document Validation

**Problem**: The `documentDataSchema` in `firebase/functions/src/documents/validation.ts` is currently defined as a single, large, and deeply nested Joi schema. This monolithic structure makes it difficult to:
- **Read and Understand**: It's hard to quickly grasp all the validation rules and their relationships.
- **Maintain**: Modifying or extending specific parts of the schema can be error-prone, as changes might inadvertently affect other parts.
- **Reuse**: Specific sub-schemas cannot be easily reused in other validation contexts.
- **Debug**: Pinpointing the exact validation rule causing an error can be challenging.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/documents/validation.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Break Down into Smaller Schemas**: Decompose the large `documentDataSchema` into smaller, more manageable, and reusable Joi schemas. For example, create separate schemas for nested objects, arrays, and different data types or common patterns.
2. **Use `Joi.object().pattern()` with Reusable Schemas**: Apply the smaller, modular schemas within the `pattern()` method of the main schema to build up the complete validation logic. This allows for a more compositional approach.
3. **Add Comments**: Add clear and concise comments to explain the purpose of each sub-schema and any complex validation rules.
4. **Consider Schema Factories**: For highly dynamic or repetitive schema structures, consider using schema factories (functions that return Joi schemas) to generate schemas programmatically.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the validation schema will be significantly easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are confined to the validation schema definition. The primary risk is ensuring that the new, modular schemas are functionally equivalent to the original monolithic schema. Thorough testing of all document validation scenarios is crucial.

**Complexity**: Medium. This change involves refactoring a complex Joi schema into smaller, more focused schemas, which requires careful decomposition and re-integration.

**Benefit**: High. This change will significantly improve the readability, maintainability, and testability of the document validation logic. It will make it easier to add new validation rules, modify existing ones, and ensure data integrity in the future.
