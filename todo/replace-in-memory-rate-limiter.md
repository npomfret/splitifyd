# Replace In-Memory Rate Limiter

**Problem**: The in-memory rate limiter implemented in `firebase/functions/src/auth/middleware.ts` is not suitable for a production environment running on Firebase Cloud Functions. It has two major flaws:
1. **Not Shared Across Instances**: Firebase Cloud Functions scale by creating multiple instances. Each instance will have its own independent in-memory rate limiter, meaning the rate limit will not be enforced correctly across all instances. A user could bypass the limit by hitting different function instances.
2. **Not Persistent**: The state of the in-memory rate limiter is lost when a function instance is recycled (which happens frequently in serverless environments). This means a user's request count will be reset every time a new instance is created, allowing them to bypass the rate limit.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/auth/middleware.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Use a Distributed Rate Limiter**: Replace the in-memory rate limiter with a distributed rate limiting solution that can share state across multiple function instances. Good options include:
    - **Redis**: A dedicated Redis instance can serve as a centralized, high-performance store for rate limit counters. This is a common and robust solution.
    - **Firestore-based solution**: Implement a rate limiter using Firestore documents to store and increment counters. This leverages existing Firebase infrastructure but might have higher latency and cost compared to Redis for very high-volume scenarios.
2. **Implement a Sliding Window Algorithm**: A sliding window algorithm is generally preferred over fixed window or leaky bucket algorithms for rate limiting, as it is more accurate and handles bursty traffic more effectively. Most distributed rate limiting libraries support this.

**Behavior Change**: This is a behavior change. The rate limiting will now be enforced correctly across all function instances and persist across function invocations. This will make the rate limiting more effective and may affect the user experience for users who previously bypassed the limit.

**Risk**: Medium. This change requires implementing a new distributed rate limiting solution, which can be complex and needs careful consideration of concurrency, consistency, and potential new infrastructure (e.g., Redis). Incorrect implementation could lead to false positives or negatives.

**Complexity**: High. This change requires implementing a new distributed rate limiting solution, which can be a significant undertaking, especially if a new external service like Redis is introduced and managed.

**Benefit**: High. This change will significantly improve the security and reliability of the application by providing a robust and effective rate limiting mechanism, protecting against abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service attempts.
