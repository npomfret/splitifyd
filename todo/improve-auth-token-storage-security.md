# Improve Authentication Token Storage Security

**Problem**: The `AuthManager` in `webapp/js/auth.js` directly stores the authentication token (ID token) and user ID in `localStorage`. While convenient for quick access, `localStorage` is highly vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. If an attacker successfully injects malicious JavaScript into the page, they can easily access the token from `localStorage` and use it to impersonate the user, leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access.

**File**: `webapp/js/auth.js`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Use HTTP-Only Cookies for Refresh Tokens**: For long-lived refresh tokens, consider storing them in HTTP-only cookies. These cookies are not accessible via JavaScript, significantly reducing the risk of XSS attacks. The backend would issue these cookies, and the frontend would use them to obtain short-lived access tokens.
2. **Use `sessionStorage` for Access Tokens**: For short-lived access tokens, `sessionStorage` can be a slightly more secure alternative to `localStorage` as its contents are cleared when the browser session ends. However, it's still vulnerable to XSS if the attacker can execute code within the same session.
3. **Implement a Secure Token Management Strategy**: A more robust solution involves a combination of HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens and in-memory storage for short-lived access tokens. The access tokens would be fetched using the refresh token and stored in memory, never persisted to `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
4. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a strict Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS attacks, which would reduce the likelihood of an attacker being able to execute malicious scripts in the first place.

**Behavior Change**: This is a behavior change. The way authentication tokens are stored will change, which will require careful coordination between the backend (for issuing HTTP-only cookies) and the frontend (for managing token retrieval and storage). This will impact the authentication flow.

**Risk**: High. This change requires careful implementation to ensure that the authentication process remains secure and functional. Incorrect implementation could lead to broken authentication or new vulnerabilities. Thorough security testing is essential.

**Complexity**: High. This change involves implementing a new token management strategy, which can be complex and may require significant modifications to both frontend and backend authentication flows.

**Benefit**: High. This change will significantly improve the security of the application by protecting authentication tokens from XSS attacks, making the application much more resilient to common web vulnerabilities.
