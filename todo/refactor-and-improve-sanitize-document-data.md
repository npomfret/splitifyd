# Refactor and Improve SanitizeDocumentData Function

**Problem**: The `sanitizeDocumentData` function in `firebase/functions/src/documents/validation.ts` has multiple responsibilities: deep cloning the input data, validating its structural depth, and then recursively sanitizing dangerous properties and strings. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, making the function harder to read, test, and maintain. Additionally, the in-place modification during sanitization can be problematic and lead to unexpected side effects if the original object is still referenced elsewhere.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/documents/validation.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Separate Concerns**: Break down `sanitizeDocumentData` into smaller, more focused functions, each with a single responsibility:
    - A dedicated function for deep cloning (as suggested in a previous `todo` to replace `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())`).
    - A dedicated function for validating document depth (e.g., `validateDocumentDepth(obj, maxDepth)`).
    - A dedicated function for recursively sanitizing dangerous properties and strings (e.g., `recursivelySanitize(obj)`).
2. **Return New Object**: The sanitization function should always return a new, sanitized object rather than modifying the input object in place. This promotes immutability and makes the function's behavior more predictable and safer.
3. **Improve Readability**: Use clear, descriptive helper functions for recursive traversal and sanitization to improve readability and make the logic easier to follow.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change in the external functionality. The application's behavior will remain the same, but the internal code structure will be significantly improved.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are localized to the `sanitizeDocumentData` function and involve breaking it down into smaller, well-defined units. As long as the individual functions are correctly implemented, the risk of introducing bugs is minimal.

**Complexity**: Medium. This change involves refactoring a complex, multi-responsibility function into smaller, more focused functions, which requires careful decomposition and re-integration.

**Benefit**: High. This change will significantly improve the readability, testability, and maintainability of the document sanitization logic. It promotes cleaner code, reduces the likelihood of side effects, and makes it easier to reason about the security aspects of data processing.
