# Incomplete Input Sanitization and XSS Protection

## Problem
- **Location**: `firebase/functions/src/utils/security.ts`
- **Description**: The `checkForDangerousPatterns` and `sanitizeString` functions use custom regular expressions to identify and remove potentially malicious content. While these functions provide a basic level of protection against XSS and prototype pollution, custom regex-based sanitization is often incomplete and prone to bypasses. Modern web applications typically require more robust and comprehensive sanitization, especially when handling user-generated content that might be rendered in a browser.
- **Current vs Expected**:
  - Current: Custom regex for security checks.
  - Expected: Utilize a well-maintained and security-audited sanitization library (e.g., `DOMPurify` for client-side, or a server-side equivalent if content is rendered on the server) to ensure comprehensive protection against various attack vectors (XSS, HTML injection, etc.).

## Solution
- **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Integrate a robust sanitization library. For server-side processing of data that will eventually be rendered on the client, a library like `sanitize-html` or `xss` could be used. For client-side rendering, `DOMPurify` is a strong choice.
- **Option 2 (Improve Custom Logic)**: If an external library cannot be used, significantly enhance the existing `checkForDangerousPatterns` and `sanitizeString` functions to cover a wider range of attack vectors, including various encoding schemes, HTML entity bypasses, and less common XSS attributes. This would involve extensive research and testing.

## Impact
- **Type**: Security improvement.
- **Risk**: Medium (implementing a new library requires careful integration; enhancing custom logic is high risk due to complexity and potential for new vulnerabilities).
- **Complexity**: Moderate to Complex.
- **Benefit**: High value (significantly improves the application's security posture against injection attacks, especially XSS).

## Implementation Notes
- Carefully evaluate the trade-offs between using an external library (easier maintenance, better security) and maintaining custom security logic (more control, but higher risk).
- Ensure that sanitization is applied at the appropriate layer (e.g., before storing user-generated content, and/or before rendering it).
