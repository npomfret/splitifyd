# Move Debounce Utility to Shared File

**Problem**: The `debounce` utility function is currently defined directly within `webapp/js/auth.js`. This function is a generic utility that is commonly used in frontend development for performance optimization (e.g., limiting the rate of function calls on input, scroll, or resize events). It does not belong specifically to the `AuthManager` and could be useful in other parts of the application. Duplicating such a utility across multiple files leads to unnecessary code repetition and makes maintenance harder.

**File**: `webapp/js/auth.js`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Create a Shared Utility File**: Create a new file (e.g., `webapp/js/utils/helpers.js` or `webapp/js/utils/debounce.js`) specifically to house common utility functions that can be reused across the `webapp` project.
2. **Move `debounce` Function**: Move the `debounce` function from `webapp/js/auth.js` to this new utility file, exporting it for use by other modules.
3. **Import and Use**: Update `webapp/js/auth.js` (and any other files that might need debouncing functionality in the future) to import and use the `debounce` function from the new shared utility file.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the code will be better organized and more modular.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are localized to the `debounce` function and its import/export. As long as the function's behavior remains identical after moving, the risk of introducing bugs is minimal.

**Complexity**: Low. This is a straightforward refactoring that involves moving code to a new file and updating import paths.

**Benefit**: Medium. This change will improve code organization, reduce code duplication, and enhance the reusability of common utility functions across the frontend application.
