# Manage Firebase SDK Imports with a Package Manager (Duplicate)

**Problem**: The `baseLayout.scripts` method in `webapp/js/templates/base-layout.js` directly imports Firebase SDKs using hardcoded URLs with specific version numbers (e.g., `https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.7.0/firebase-app-compat.js`). This is a duplicate of the issue identified in `webapp/js/firebase-config.js` and has the same drawbacks:
1. **Version Management**: Updating Firebase SDK versions requires manual changes to these URLs across the codebase.
2. **Dependency on CDN**: It creates a direct dependency on Google's CDN.
3. **Lack of Bundling**: It prevents the use of modern JavaScript bundling techniques.

**File**: `webapp/js/templates/base-layout.js`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Introduce a Package Manager**: Use a package manager like npm or Yarn to install Firebase SDKs as project dependencies.
2. **Implement a Bundler**: Integrate a JavaScript bundler (e.g., Webpack, Rollup, Parcel) into the build process.
3. **Update Imports**: Change the import statements in `base-layout.js` (and other relevant files) to use standard module imports (e.g., `import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';`).

**Behavior Change**: This is a build-time change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the way Firebase SDKs are managed and bundled will change.

**Risk**: Medium. This change requires setting up a build process with a package manager and a bundler, which can be complex.

**Complexity**: High. This change requires a significant overhaul of the frontend's dependency management and build strategy.

**Benefit**: High. This change will significantly improve dependency management, enable modern bundling optimizations, and make it easier to update Firebase SDK versions.
