# Extract User Creation Logic to a Dedicated Handler

**Problem**: The business logic for creating a user document in Firestore is currently implemented directly within the `/createUserDocument` route handler in `firebase/functions/src/index.ts`. This violates the principle of separation of concerns, making the `index.ts` file (which should primarily handle routing and middleware application) overly complex. It also makes the user creation logic harder to test in isolation and reuse if needed elsewhere.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/index.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Create a New Handler File**: Create a new file, `firebase/functions/src/users/handlers.ts`, to house all user-related route handlers and their associated business logic.
2. **Extract the Logic**: Move the user document creation logic (including validation, Firestore interaction, and response handling) from the `/createUserDocument` route handler in `index.ts` to a new `createUserDocument` function within `users/handlers.ts`.
3. **Update the Route**: Modify the `/createUserDocument` route in `index.ts` to import and call the new `createUserDocument` handler from `users/handlers.ts`. This keeps `index.ts` clean and focused on routing.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but the code will be better organized, more modular, and easier to test and maintain.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are localized to the user creation logic and involve moving code between files. As long as the logic is moved correctly and imports are updated, the risk of side effects is minimal.

**Complexity**: Low. This is a straightforward refactoring that involves moving code to a new file and updating import paths.

**Benefit**: High. This change will significantly improve the structure of the code, making it more modular, testable, and easier to understand. It promotes a cleaner separation of concerns within the backend.
