# Use Structured Logger in getFirebaseConfigResponse

**Problem**: The `getFirebaseConfigResponse` function in `firebase/functions/src/utils/config.ts` uses `console.error` directly for logging an error. This bypasses the structured logging mechanism (`logger`) used throughout the rest of the application, leading to inconsistent log formats and potentially missing context in monitoring systems.

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/utils/config.ts`

**Suggested Solution**:
1. **Replace `console.error` with `logger.error`**: Update the `console.error` call to use `logger.error` or `logger.errorWithContext`.
2. **Provide Relevant Context**: Ensure that the error log includes relevant context, such as the environment variables being checked, to aid in debugging.

**Behavior Change**: This is a pure refactoring with no behavior change. The application's functionality will remain the same, but logging will be consistent.

**Risk**: Low. The changes are localized to the logging statement and are unlikely to have any side effects.

**Complexity**: Low. This is a straightforward change that involves replacing a single line of code.

**Benefit**: Medium. This change will improve the consistency and observability of application logs, making it easier to diagnose issues related to client configuration.
