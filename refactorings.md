# Suggested refactorings for splitifyd

## Analysis Summary

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several areas for improvement. The code is generally well-structured with good security practices, but there are opportunities to simplify, eliminate redundancy, and improve maintainability.

## Top 3 Refactoring Recommendations

## Additional Quick Wins

- **Remove unused `configFn` duplicate logic** in `firebase/functions/src/index.ts:119-134` (already handled by Express app)
- **Simplify logger emoji logic** in development mode - overly complex for the value provided
- **Consolidate CORS handling** - currently split between multiple locations
- **Remove unnecessary `applyStandardMiddleware` function wrapping** in `function-factory.ts`

## Build & Deployment Notes

✅ **Build system is simple and appropriate** - Uses standard TypeScript compilation
✅ **No complex build tooling** - Straightforward Firebase Functions deployment  
✅ **Dependencies are minimal and current** - No outdated packages detected
