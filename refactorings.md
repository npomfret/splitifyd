# Top 1 Refactoring Recommendation for Splitifyd

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Firebase Cloud Functions codebase, here is the highest-impact refactoring opportunity identified:

## 1. **Replace Silent Error Degradation with Proper Circuit Breaker** âš¡ **IMPORTANT**

**Problem:** Multiple places catch errors and continue with degraded functionality without proper circuit breaking or recovery strategies.

**Locations:**
- Cursor parsing failures (`documents/handlers.ts:203-212`)
- Health check partial failures (`index.ts:93-115`) 
- Optional auth token failures (`auth/middleware.ts:174-179`)

**Impact:** **HIGH** - System reliability and debugging
**Effort:** **MEDIUM** - Implement proper error boundaries
**Fix:** Add circuit breaker library and structured degradation policies

---

## Summary

**Medium-term Actions:**
1. Implement circuit breaker pattern

**Overall Assessment:** The codebase is well-structured with excellent import hygiene and minimal unused code. The main issues are around error handling patterns and some unnecessary complexity in configuration management. No major architectural problems were found.
