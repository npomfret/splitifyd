# Security Configuration Guide

## Overview

This document explains additional security considerations for the Splitifyd application beyond the core configuration covered in [TECHNICAL_CONFIG.md](TECHNICAL_CONFIG.md).

## Firebase Web API Key Background

Firebase Web API keys are designed to be public and are meant to identify your Firebase project. They are NOT secret keys and are protected by:
- Firebase Security Rules
- Domain restrictions
- App restrictions

However, as a best practice, we've implemented an environment-based configuration system (see [TECHNICAL_CONFIG.md](TECHNICAL_CONFIG.md) for details).

## Questions or Concerns?

If you have security concerns or questions, please:
1. Review Firebase security documentation
2. Check Google Cloud security best practices
3. Consider hiring a security consultant for production deployments
4. Refer to [TECHNICAL_CONFIG.md](TECHNICAL_CONFIG.md) for technical security implementation details
