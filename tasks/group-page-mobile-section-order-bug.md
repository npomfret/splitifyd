# Bug Report: Incorrect Section Order on Group Page in Mobile View

## Description

In the mobile view of the group page, the various sections (e.g., expenses list, member list, activity feed) appear in an illogical or "weird" order. This makes navigation and understanding the group's information difficult for users on mobile devices. The current ordering does not follow a clear hierarchy or user flow, potentially leading to a poor user experience.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Access the application on a mobile device or a browser with a mobile viewport size.
2. Navigate to any group's detail page.
3. Observe the arrangement and sequence of the different content sections on the page.

## Expected Behavior

The sections on the group page in mobile view should be ordered logically, following a clear and intuitive flow (e.g., Group Summary -> Expenses -> Members -> Activity). The ordering should prioritize key information and common user interactions.

## Actual Behavior

The sections are arranged in an unexpected or disorienting order, making it hard to find specific information or complete tasks.
