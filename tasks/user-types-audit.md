# User Type Definitions Audit & Refactoring Plan

## 1. Overview

A comprehensive audit of the entire TypeScript codebase was conducted to identify and analyze every type or interface representing an application user. The audit revealed significant redundancy, inconsistency, and misuse of user-related types across the `packages/shared`, `firebase/functions`, and `webapp-v2` packages. This leads to confusion, increases the maintenance burden, and creates potential for bugs due to data mismatches between different layers of the application.

This document outlines the key findings and proposes a phased refactoring plan to unify user types, establishing a single source of truth and improving the overall robustness and clarity of the codebase.

## 2. Key Findings

The audit identified multiple, slightly different definitions for the same core concepts of a "user" and a "group member".

### Finding 1: Redundant Core User Types (Partially Resolved)

The concept of a "user profile" was previously defined in at least four different places with minor variations. Phase 1 of the refactoring has addressed most of this duplication:

- **`@splitifyd/shared`**: `RegisteredUser` - Now firmly established as the canonical type for a user's Firestore document.
- **`firebase/functions/src/services/UserService2.ts`**: The internal `UserProfile` interface has been successfully removed, and the service now uses the shared `RegisteredUser` type.
- **`webapp-v2/src/types/auth.ts`**: The local `User` type has been replaced with `ClientUser` from the shared package. However, the `auth.ts` file itself is now largely redundant.
- **`firebase/functions/src/auth/middleware.ts`**: The anonymous type on `AuthenticatedRequest['user']` has been replaced with the lean `AuthenticatedUser` type from the shared package.

While the core duplication is resolved, there is still an opportunity to clean up the remaining type definition file in `webapp-v2`.

### Finding 2: Inconsistent Property Naming (Mostly Resolved)

- **`uid` vs. `userId`**: The unique identifier for a user is now consistently named `uid` across most new and refactored interfaces, aligning with the Firebase Auth standard. The `UserId` branded type is used for type safety. A full audit to eliminate any remaining instances of `userId` is still recommended as part of the final cleanup phase.

### Finding 3: Over-exposure of Data in API Responses

- The `getGroupMembersResponseFromSubcollection` method in `UserService2.ts` still returns an array of `GroupMemberWithProfile` objects. This type extends the full `RegisteredUser` Firestore model, meaning sensitive or unnecessary data (like `acceptedPolicies`, `termsAcceptedAt`, etc.) is exposed to the client when simply listing group members. This is the primary focus of **Phase 2**.

### Finding 4: Lack of a Single Source of Truth (Resolved)

- The previous issue of services and frontend stores defining their own local versions of user types has been resolved. `@splitifyd/shared` is now the definitive source of truth for all user-related types.

## 3. Refactoring & Unification Plan

To address these issues, a phased refactoring approach is recommended.

### Phase 1: Unify the Core `User` Type (COMPLETED)

This phase has been successfully implemented, establishing `RegisteredUser` as the canonical user type.

### Phase 2: Introduce Lean Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

To prevent over-exposing data, we will create specific DTOs for API responses.

1.  **Create `GroupMemberDTO`**:
    - In `@splitifyd/shared/src/shared-types.ts`, define a new `GroupMemberDTO` interface.
    - This DTO will contain only the fields necessary for displaying a user in a group list: `uid`, `displayName`, `email`, `photoURL`, `initials`, and `themeColor`.

2.  **Update `UserService2.ts`**:
    - Modify the `getGroupMembersResponseFromSubcollection` method.
    - Instead of returning `GroupMemberWithProfile[]`, it will now fetch the necessary data and map it to the new `GroupMemberDTO[]`, returning only the essential fields to the client.

3.  **Update Frontend Components**:
    - Refactor components in `webapp-v2` that consume the group members list (e.g., `MembersList.tsx`) to use the new `GroupMemberDTO` type. This will improve frontend performance and reduce data over-fetching.

### Phase 3: Standardize and Clean Up

1.  **Standardize `uid`**:
    - Audit all remaining user-related interfaces and ensure the property for the user's unique identifier is consistently named `uid`.
    - Continue to use the `UserId` branded type for this property.

2.  **Refactor Test Data Builders**:
    - Update `UserProfileBuilder` and any other test data builders to use and generate objects conforming to the new unified `RegisteredUser` and `GroupMemberDTO` types. This will ensure that tests are aligned with the new, stricter data models.

3.  **Remove Redundant Type Files**:
    - Delete the `webapp-v2/src/types/auth.ts` file and update all imports to point directly to `@splitifyd/shared`.

## 4. Implementation Status

### âœ… Phase 1: COMPLETED (December 2024)

**Phase 1 has been successfully implemented with the following achievements:**

#### Enhanced Shared Types (`@splitifyd/shared`)
- **Expanded RegisteredUser interface** with all missing fields:
  - Added `emailVerified: boolean` for Firebase Auth verification status
  - Added `photoURL?: string | null` for profile photo URLs
  - Added `createdAt?: Date | FirestoreTimestamp` for document creation timestamp
  - Added `updatedAt?: Date | FirestoreTimestamp` for document modification timestamp
- **Created derived types for specific use cases**:
  - `AuthenticatedUser`: Minimal auth context (`uid`, `email`, `displayName`, `role`)
  - `ClientUser`: Frontend-focused type excluding sensitive server data
- **Comprehensive documentation** added for all user types explaining their purpose and usage

#### Backend Refactoring
- **Removed redundant UserProfile interface** from `UserService2.ts`
- **Updated all service methods** to use and return `RegisteredUser` from shared package
- **Fixed AuthenticatedRequest interface** to use the new `AuthenticatedUser` type
- **Eliminated anti-patterns**:
  - Removed dynamic import pattern in `balance/types.ts`
  - Replaced unsafe `as any` casts with proper type coercion in `SettlementService.ts`
- **Updated all service dependencies** to use the unified types

#### Frontend Unification
- **Replaced local User interface** with `ClientUser` from shared package
- **Updated auth and theme stores** to use shared types consistently
- **Fixed API schema validation** to match backend SystemUserRoles format
- **Resolved frontend/backend schema mismatches** that were causing e2e test failures

#### Test & Validation Fixes
- **Updated all test fixtures** to include newly required fields (`emailVerified`, `photoURL`)
- **Fixed schema validation tests** to match new type requirements
- **Corrected service import paths** in affected test files
- **All e2e tests now pass consistently** after schema validation fixes

#### Technical Debt Reduction
- **Eliminated type casting anti-patterns** throughout the codebase
- **Standardized import patterns** to use proper module imports
- **Fixed circular dependency issues** between services
- **Improved type safety** across all layers of the application

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: PENDING

Phase 2 (Lean DTOs) is ready for implementation when needed. The current Phase 1 implementation provides a solid foundation for the next phase.

### ðŸ”„ Phase 3: PENDING

Phase 3 (Standardization & Cleanup) awaits Phase 2 completion.

## 5. Expected Benefits

- **Improved Type Safety**: A single source of truth for user types will eliminate a whole class of potential bugs related to data inconsistencies.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Developers will no longer need to map between multiple, slightly different user types.
- **Enhanced Security**: By using lean DTOs, we will no longer expose sensitive or unnecessary user data in API responses.
- **Better Maintainability**: A unified data model is easier to understand, maintain, and extend in the future.

## 6. Lessons Learned from Phase 1

- **Frontend/Backend Schema Alignment**: Critical to ensure Zod schemas match backend enum formats exactly
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test updates were essential to catch breaking changes early
- **Incremental Validation**: Running tests frequently during refactoring prevented cascading issues
- **Type Safety Benefits**: The unified types immediately caught several latent bugs in the codebase
