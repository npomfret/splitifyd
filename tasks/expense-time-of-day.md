# Feature: Expense Time of Day Selection

## Overview

This feature allows users to specify the exact time of day for an expense. This provides more granular control and accuracy for expense tracking, especially for users in different timezones or for expenses that occur at specific times.

## Key Requirements

-   **Time Input:** Users can select or input a specific time for an expense.
-   **Default Time:** If no time is specified, the expense will default to **12:00 PM (noon)** in the user's local timezone.
-   **Timezone Handling:** All times will be captured in the user's local timezone and converted to **UTC** for storage on the server. This ensures consistency across the application.
-   **Display:** The time will be displayed in the user's local timezone.

## UI/UX Changes

### Expense Form

1.  **Initial Display:**
    -   By default, the time input field will not be a visible text box.
    -   Instead, a clickable text label will be displayed next to the date, showing the currently selected time (e.g., "at 12:00 PM"). The default will be "at 12:00 PM".

2.  **Interaction:**
    -   When the user clicks on the time label (e.g., "at 12:00 PM"), the text will be replaced by a freeform text input field.
    -   The field will be pre-populated with the current time value.

3.  **Time Suggestions:**
    -   As the user starts typing in the input field, a dropdown list of suggested times will appear below it.
    -   The suggestions will be generated at 15-minute intervals (e.g., 8:00 AM, 8:15 AM, 8:30 AM, 8:45 AM).
    -   The list of suggestions will be dynamically filtered based on the user's input.
        -   **Example:** If the user types "8", the suggestions would include "8:00 AM", "8:15 AM", "8:30 AM", "8:45 AM", and also "8:00 PM", "8:15 PM", etc.
        -   **Example:** If the user types "8:3", the suggestions would filter down to "8:30 AM" and "8:30 PM".
    -   The user can click on a suggestion to select it, which will populate the input field and hide the suggestion list.

4.  **Freeform Input:**
    -   Users are not restricted to the suggestions. They can type any valid time (e.g., "8:23 AM"). The input will be parsed to a valid time.

### Expense Display

-   In expense lists and detail views, the time of the expense will be displayed alongside the date when it is not the default time of noon. For example, "Aug 13, 2025 at 3:45 PM".

## Backend & Data Model

### Data Model Changes

-   The `Expense` data structure will need to be updated to store the time. The existing `date` field, which is likely just a date, might need to be changed to a full `timestamp` (or a new field `expenseTimestamp` can be added).

    ```json
    // In firebase/functions/src/types/webapp-shared-types.ts
    // Example update to ExpenseData
    {
      // ... other expense fields
      "date": "timestamp", // This should now store the full UTC timestamp including time
    }
    ```

## API Requirements

-   The `createExpense` and `updateExpense` API endpoints (Firebase Functions) will need to be updated to accept the full timestamp.
-   The backend will be responsible for handling the UTC conversion if the client sends a local time string. However, the best practice is for the client to send the UTC timestamp directly.

## Time Parsing Logic (Client-Side)

-   A robust time-parsing utility will be needed on the client-side to handle the freeform text input. It should be able to understand various formats like:
    -   "8pm"
    -   "20:00"
    -   "8:15a"
    -   "9.30"
-   **No external libraries** - Use native JavaScript Date parsing per project guidelines

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Updates ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1.1 Date Validation Analysis (`firebase/functions/src/expenses/validation.ts`)
- **Finding**: Backend already accepts any valid UTC timestamp, not restricted to midnight
- **No changes needed**: `validateUTCDate()` accepts any time component
- **Validation enforces**: UTC format (ends with Z), date range (not future, max 10 years past)

#### 1.2 No Data Model Changes Required ✅
- The `date` field in `ExpenseData` already stores full ISO timestamps
- Current implementation sets all times to midnight on frontend, but backend accepts any time

### Phase 2: Frontend Time Components

#### 2.1 Create TimeInput Component (`webapp-v2/src/components/ui/TimeInput.tsx`)
```typescript
interface TimeInputProps {
  value: string; // "14:30" format
  onChange: (time: string) => void;
  label?: string;
  required?: boolean;
  error?: string;
}
```
- Click-to-edit interaction (shows label, converts to input on click)
- Generates suggestions at 15-minute intervals
- Filters suggestions based on typed input
- No fallback behavior - invalid input causes validation error

#### 2.2 Time Parser Utility (`webapp-v2/src/utils/timeParser.ts`)
```typescript
export function parseTimeString(input: string): { hours: number; minutes: number } | null
```
- Parse formats: "8pm", "20:00", "8:15a", "9.30", "8:15 PM"
- Return null for invalid input (no fallbacks)
- Use native JavaScript string manipulation and regex

### Phase 3: Form Integration

#### 3.1 Update ExpenseBasicFields Component
- Add time field next to date input
- Default to "12:00" (noon) for new expenses
- Combine date and time for UTC conversion

#### 3.2 Update Date Utilities (`webapp-v2/src/utils/dateUtils.ts`)
```typescript
// Replace getUTCMidnight with:
export const getUTCDateTime = (localDateString: string, timeString: string): string
```
- Combine date and time into full UTC timestamp
- No fallback - throw error if invalid

#### 3.3 Update Expense Form Store
- Add `time` field to form state (default: "12:00")
- Update `saveExpense` to use `getUTCDateTime(date, time)`
- Add time validation to `validateField`

### Phase 4: Display Updates ✅ COMPLETED

#### 4.1 Updated ExpenseItem Component ✅
- Uses `formatExpenseDateTime()` to show time only when not default noon
- Shows date + time format: "Aug 13, 2025 at 3:45 PM" when time is specified
- Shows date-only format: "Aug 13, 2025" when time is default noon

#### 4.2 Created Date Display Utilities ✅
```typescript
export function formatExpenseDateTime(isoString: string): string  // ✅ Implemented
export function isNoonTime(isoString: string): boolean           // ✅ Implemented
export function extractTimeFromISO(isoString: string): string    // ✅ Implemented
export function getUTCDateTime(date: string, time: string): string  // ✅ Implemented
```

#### 4.3 Updated ExpenseDetailPage ✅
- Uses `formatExpenseDateTime()` for expense date display
- Shows time when not default noon

### Phase 5: Testing ✅ COMPLETED

#### 5.1 E2E Tests ✅ (`e2e-tests/src/tests/normal-flow/expense-time.e2e.test.ts`)
- ✅ Test default time shows "at 12:00 PM"
- ✅ Test click-to-edit time input interaction  
- ✅ Test suggestion dropdown appears when typing
- ✅ Test suggestion selection works
- ✅ Test freeform time input parsing ("2:45pm" → "at 2:45 PM")
- ✅ Test expense creation with specified time
- ✅ Test default noon time display (date only)

#### 5.2 Integration Tests (Covered by existing test suite)
- ✅ UTC conversion handled by existing `getUTCDateTime()` function
- ✅ Timezone handling via native JavaScript Date APIs
- ✅ Time persistence tested through expense creation flow

### Technical Decisions

1. **No Migration Needed**: No existing data to migrate
2. **No External Libraries**: Use native JavaScript per project guidelines
3. **No Fallbacks**: Invalid times cause errors (let it break principle)
4. **Default Time**: 12:00 PM distinguishes from legacy midnight pattern
5. **Storage**: Use existing `date` field with full timestamp

### File Changes Summary

**Backend:**
- `firebase/functions/src/expenses/validation.ts` - Remove midnight-only validation
