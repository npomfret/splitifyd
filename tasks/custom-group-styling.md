## Task: Implement Custom Group Styling and Personalization

**Goal:**
Allow users to personalize the appearance of their group pages, making them more engaging and unique. This feature will give users a sense of ownership over their shared spaces.

**Justification:**
Personalization features are known to increase user engagement and emotional connection to a product. By allowing users to customize their groups, we can make the app feel more fun, social, and sticky.

### Feature Ideas & Creative Concepts

Here are several ideas, ranging from simple to more advanced, for how users could style their groups.

#### 1. Group Header/Banner Image

- **Concept:** The most prominent and impactful customization. Users can upload a custom header image that appears at the top of their group detail page, similar to a Facebook group or Twitter profile banner.
- **Implementation:**
    - An "Upload Header" button on the group settings page.
    - Images would be uploaded to a dedicated folder in Firebase Storage (e.g., `group-assets/{groupId}/header.jpg`).
    - The image URL would be stored in the group's document in Firestore.
    - We should provide recommended dimensions and handle image resizing/cropping.

#### 2. Custom Group Color Theme

- **Concept:** Users can select a primary "theme color" for their group. This color would be applied to key UI elements like page headers, buttons, links, and highlights within that specific group's view.
- **Implementation:**
    - Provide a pre-selected palette of 8-12 attractive colors to choose from. This prevents users from picking jarring or unreadable colors.
    - Store the selected hex code (e.g., `#4A90E2`) in the group's Firestore document.
    - The frontend would use this color to dynamically style the components when viewing that group.

#### 3. Group Avatar/Icon

- **Concept:** In addition to a name, each group can have a unique avatar or icon. This icon would represent the group in lists, sidebars, and notifications, making it easier to identify at a glance.
- **Implementation:**
    - Users could choose between uploading a small custom image or selecting from a library of pre-made icons (e.g., icons for "Housemates," "Vacation," "Dinner Club," "Team Project").
    - The icon/image URL would be stored in the group's document.

#### 4. Background Textures & Patterns

- **Concept:** For a more subtle customization, allow users to apply a light, tiling background pattern or texture to their group page. This adds personality without overwhelming the content.
- **Implementation:**
    - Offer a curated library of high-quality, seamless patterns (e.g., subtle geometric shapes, light gradients, textures like paper or wood).
    - Store the identifier for the selected pattern in the group's document.

#### 5. "Sticker" or "Flair" System (Advanced)

- **Concept:** A more playful and social feature. Users could unlock or be awarded decorative "stickers" or "flairs" for achieving certain milestones (e.g., "First 100 Expenses," "Globetrotter" for using multiple currencies, "Anniversary" badge).
- **Implementation:**
    - These would be small, decorative images that users could choose to display in a designated area of their group page.
    - This would require a more complex system for awarding and storing which flairs a group has earned and selected.

### Technical Considerations

- **Storage:** All user-uploaded content (headers, avatars) must be stored in Firebase Storage with appropriate security rules.
- **Data Model:** The group's document in Firestore should have a `customization` map to hold all these settings:
    ```json
    {
        "groupName": "Trip to Japan",
        // ... other fields
        "customization": {
            "headerImageUrl": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...",
            "themeColor": "#D0021B",
            "avatarUrl": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...",
            "backgroundPattern": "geometric-1"
        }
    }
    ```
- **Permissions:** Decide who can edit these settings. Is it only the group creator, or can any group member customize the page? A good starting point would be creator-only or creator-and-admins.
