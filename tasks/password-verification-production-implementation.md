# Password Verification Production Implementation

## Context

During debugging of the password change functionality, we discovered that the `verifyPassword` method in `FirebaseAuthService.ts` was not implemented, causing password change operations to fail with "Authentication service error".

## Current State

**File**: `firebase/functions/src/services/auth/FirebaseAuthService.ts:572-601`

The current implementation is a **development-only solution** that:

- Only checks if the user exists via `getUserByEmail()`
- Always returns `true` if user exists (doesn't actually verify password)
- Has unused `password` parameter (causing TS6133 warning)
- Contains clear documentation that this is emulator-only
- Has no production fallback anywhere else in the codebase—Unit tests use `StubAuthService.verifyPassword`, which also short-circuits to `true`, so no automated check currently guards against deploying this stub.

```typescript
async verifyPassword(email: string, password: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Firebase Admin SDK doesn't have direct password verification
    // For emulator mode, we simulate password verification by checking if user exists
    // In production, this would need a proper implementation using Firebase Auth REST API

    // First, verify the user exists
    const userRecord = await this.auth.getUserByEmail(email);
    if (!userRecord) {
        return false;
    }

    // In emulator mode, we'll assume password verification succeeds if user exists
    // This is a simplified implementation for development/testing
    return true;
}
```

## Production Requirements

For production deployment, this method **MUST** be properly implemented to actually verify passwords. Current implementation is a **security risk** in production.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Firebase Auth REST API Integration**
    - Use Firebase Auth REST API `signInWithPassword` endpoint
    - Handle emulator vs production endpoints correctly
    - Proper error handling for invalid credentials vs service errors

2. **Configuration Requirements**
    - Proper Firebase API key configuration
    - Environment-specific endpoint handling
    - No fallback values that could mask configuration issues

3. **Security Considerations**
    - Proper logging (without exposing passwords)
    - Handle all Firebase Auth error scenarios
    - Ensure no credential information leaks in error messages

### Example Production Implementation Structure

```typescript
async verifyPassword(email: string, password: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Get Firebase config
    const apiKey = this.auth.app.options.apiKey;
    if (!apiKey) {
        throw new Error('Firebase API key not configured');
    }

    // Determine auth endpoint (emulator vs production)
    const authUrl = this.getAuthEndpoint();

    try {
        const response = await this.makeAuthRequest(authUrl, {
            email,
            password,
            returnSecureToken: true
        });

        return response.ok;
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle specific error cases
        if (this.isInvalidCredentialsError(error)) {
            return false;
        }
        throw error; // Re-throw service errors
    }
}
```

## Action Items

1. **Before Production Deployment**:
    - [ ] Implement proper password verification using Firebase Auth REST API
    - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for all auth scenarios
    - [ ] Write integration tests covering both valid/invalid credentials
    - [ ] Remove the TS6133 warning by using the password parameter
    - [ ] Ensure higher-level rate limiting strategy is in place (tracked outside this doc)

2. **Testing Requirements**:
    - [ ] Test with valid credentials (should return `true`)
    - [ ] Test with invalid password (should return `false`)
    - [ ] Test with non-existent user (should return `false`)
    - [ ] Test service error scenarios (should throw)
    - [ ] Test configuration missing scenarios (should throw)

3. **Security Review**:
    - [ ] Audit for credential leaks in logs/errors
    - [ ] Review error messages for information disclosure

## Implementation Plan (2024-XX-XX)

1. Introduce a shared REST client in `FirebaseAuthService` that can call the Identity Toolkit endpoints using the project’s API key (reuse emulator URL handling from `packages/test-support/ApiDriver` to avoid duplication).
2. Wire configuration through existing service setup so production deploys fail fast if the API key or endpoint is missing.
3. Expand `StubAuthService.verifyPassword` to hold hashed password state so unit tests can assert real success/failure paths once the live implementation lands.
4. Add unit tests for the new client (success, invalid credentials, transport failure) and an integration smoke test that exercises the emulator path.
5. Document how rate limiting is handled at the ingress layer so this service stays focused on verification.

## Risk Level

**HIGH** - Current implementation allows any password for existing users in production

- `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/user-management-comprehensive.e2e.test.ts` - Test coverage

## Notes

- The current fix resolves the immediate test failure and allows development to continue
- This is explicitly documented as emulator-only to prevent accidental production deployment
- The interface contract is correct, only implementation needs completion
