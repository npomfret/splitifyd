# Paid By Field Autocomplete

The "paid by" field in the expense form should be an autocompleting dropdown, similar to the currency selector.

**Current:** Unknown - needs investigation.

**Desired:** Autocomplete dropdown that filters group members as user types, similar to currency selector UX.

**Related:** Label selector may also benefit from similar treatment (though labels are free-form).
