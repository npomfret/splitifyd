'''# Group & User Analytics and Visualizations

## Feature Description

This feature introduces a new "Analytics" tab at both the group and user levels to provide insightful and visually engaging representations of spending habits. The goal is to move beyond simple charts and offer creative visualizations that help users understand their financial behavior in a more intuitive and compelling way.

## Key Concepts

We will introduce two primary visualization concepts:

1.  **The Financial Forest:** Each expense category is represented by a different species of tree. As a user spends in a category, the corresponding tree grows. This provides a quick, organic representation of where money is flowing. A user can see at a glance which "trees" in their financial forest are the largest.

2.  **The Spending Galaxy:** This visualization represents the user's financial ecosystem as a solar system.
    - **The Sun:** Represents the user's total income or budget for the month.
    - **Planets:** Each expense category is a planet orbiting the sun. The size of the planet is proportional to the total spending in that category.
    - **Moons:** Individual transactions are moons orbiting their respective category-planet.
    - **Orbit:** The distance of a planet from the sun can represent the "essential" vs. "discretionary" nature of the spending.

## Implementation

- **Data Aggregation:** We will need to build robust data aggregation pipelines to power these visualizations. This will likely involve new Firebase Functions to process and summarize expense data.
- **Visualization Library:** We will use a powerful and flexible charting library like **D3.js** or **Three.js** to create these interactive visualizations.
- **User Interface:** The new "Analytics" tab will be available from the main user dashboard (for global analytics) and from within each group's detail page (for group-specific analytics).

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new "Analytics" tab is present at the user and group levels.
- Users can switch between the "Financial Forest" and "Spending Galaxy" visualizations.
- The visualizations are interactive, allowing users to hover over elements to see more details (e.g., hover over a tree to see the total amount spent in that category).
- The data is accurate and updates in near real-time as new expenses are added.
