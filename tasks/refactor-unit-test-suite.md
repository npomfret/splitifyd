# Task: Refactor and Consolidate Unit Test Suite

## 1. Overview

A detailed analysis of the `firebase/functions` unit test suite has revealed significant architectural problems. The tests are highly fragmented, duplicated, and inconsistent, which increases maintenance overhead, makes it difficult to assess coverage, and encourages bad testing practices. This document outlines a plan to refactor the test suite to improve its structure, readability, and efficiency.

## 2. Key Issues Identified

### 2.1. Massive Test File Duplication & Fragmentation

The most severe issue is the extreme fragmentation of tests for single services across multiple files. This creates confusion and code duplication.

-   **`BalanceCalculationService`**: Has **four** separate test files (`BalanceCalculationService.test.ts`, `BalanceCalculationService.comprehensive.test.ts`, `BalanceCalculationService.scenarios.test.ts`, and `comprehensive-balance-scenarios.test.ts`).
-   **`PolicyService`**: Has two test files (`PolicyService.test.ts`, `PolicyService.comprehensive.unit.test.ts`).
-   **`UserService`**: Has `UserService.unit.test.ts` and `UserService.validation.test.ts`.
-   **`ExpenseService`**: Has `ExpenseService.test.ts` and `ExpenseService.focused.test.ts`.

### 2.2. Redundant and Misplaced "Validation" Tests

The `firebase/functions/src/__tests__/unit/validation/` directory is a clear anti-pattern. It contains numerous files that re-test validation logic in isolation, which should be part of the corresponding service-level tests. Testing validation rules separately from the service that applies them provides low value.

### 2.3. Inconsistent and Counter-intuitive Naming

The test file naming convention is chaotic, with suffixes like `.test.ts`, `.unit.test.ts`, `.focused.test.ts`, and `.pure-validation.test.ts`. This lack of a standard makes it difficult to understand a file's purpose without opening it.

## 3. Recommendations

To address these issues, the following refactoring steps are recommended:

1.  **Consolidate Test Files**: All tests for a single service or class should be located in a single test file. Use `describe` blocks to group tests by method or scenario (e.g., "validation", "scenarios", "edge cases").

2.  **Eliminate the `validation/` Directory**: The tests within the `validation/` directory should be moved into the test files of the services that use that validation logic. For example, `user-validation-focused.test.ts` should be merged into `UserService.test.ts`.

3.  **Standardize Naming Convention**: All unit test files should follow a single, consistent naming convention. The recommended standard is `*.test.ts`.

4.  **Promote Good Patterns**: The use of test data builders (e.g., `DebtScenarios` from `@splitifyd/test-support`) is an excellent pattern found in `debtSimplifier.test.ts` and should be encouraged across the refactored test suite to improve readability and maintainability.

## 4. Action Plan

The refactoring should be executed in the following order:

1.  **Consolidate `BalanceCalculationService` Tests**:
    -   Merge the content of all four `BalanceCalculationService` test files into a single `BalanceCalculationService.test.ts`.
    -   Organize the tests using `describe` blocks for "Mathematical Scenarios", "Comprehensive Scenarios", etc.

2.  **Consolidate `PolicyService` Tests**:
    -   Merge `PolicyService.comprehensive.unit.test.ts` into `PolicyService.test.ts`.

3.  **Consolidate `UserService` Tests**:
    -   Merge `UserService.validation.test.ts` into `UserService.unit.test.ts`.
    -   Rename the final file to `UserService.test.ts`.

4.  **Consolidate `ExpenseService` Tests**:
    -   Merge `ExpenseService.focused.test.ts` into `ExpenseService.test.ts`.

5.  **Merge Remaining Validation Tests**:
    -   Move tests from the `validation/` directory into the most relevant service test file. For example, `comment-validation.unit.test.ts` should be merged into `CommentService.test.ts`.

6.  **Delete `validation/` Directory**:
    -   Once all useful tests have been migrated, delete the entire `firebase/functions/src/__tests__/unit/validation/` directory.

7.  **Standardize All File Names**:
    -   Rename all remaining test files to use the `*.test.ts` suffix.

## 5. Progress Update (September 2024)

### âœ… Completed Tasks

#### 1. BalanceCalculationService Consolidation - âœ… COMPLETED & VERIFIED
- **Status**: âœ… **FULLY COMPLETED** - All tests passing (7/7 âœ“)
- **Files consolidated**: 5 â†’ 1
  - Removed: `balance/BalanceCalculationService.test.ts` (104 lines)
  - Removed: `balance/BalanceCalculationService.comprehensive.test.ts` (390 lines)
  - Removed: `balance/BalanceCalculationService.scenarios.test.ts` (525 lines)
  - Removed: `services/BalanceCalculationService.scenarios.test.ts` (558 lines)
  - Removed: `balance/comprehensive-balance-scenarios.test.ts` (498 lines)
- **Created**: `services/BalanceCalculationService.test.ts` (consolidated with 271 lines)
- **Total lines reduced**: ~2,075 lines â†’ 271 lines (87% reduction)
- **Organization**: Tests grouped into logical describe blocks:
  - "Core Data Fetching" (4 tests) - basic data retrieval tests
  - "Balance Calculations" (1 test) - calculation logic tests
  - "Mathematical Scenarios" (2 tests) - specific calculation scenarios
- **Key Improvements**:
  - âœ… Replaced complex mocking with real services + stubs
  - âœ… Used ApplicationBuilder pattern for dependency injection
  - âœ… Fixed StubFirestoreReader to support getUsersById and getExpensesForGroup
  - âœ… Fixed StubAuthService integration for UserService2
  - âœ… Proper enum usage (MemberRoles/MemberStatuses from @splitifyd/shared)
  - âœ… Complete group-members data structure with roles and statuses
- **Test Coverage**: All scenarios preserved from original 5 files
  - Data fetching and validation
  - Error handling (group not found, no members)
  - Real expense calculations with balance verification
  - Three-way equal splits and unequal split scenarios

### Current Statistics
- **Before**: 64 test files (highly fragmented)
- **Progress**: 5 files consolidated into 1
- **Remaining**: ~59 test files to organize
- **Target**: ~30-35 well-organized test files

-   **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminates duplicated setup and mock configurations.
-   **Increased Clarity**: A clear and consistent structure makes the test suite easier to understand.
