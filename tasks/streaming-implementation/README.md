# Streaming Implementation for Splitifyd

This directory contains all documentation and planning for implementing real-time streaming capabilities in Splitifyd.

## Overview

The streaming implementation follows a phased approach to progressively add real-time capabilities while maintaining system stability and controlling costs.

## Current Status

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | ✅ COMPLETED | Core infrastructure & change detection |
| **Phase 2** | ✅ COMPLETED | Smart REST with auto-refresh |
| **Phase 3** | ✅ COMPLETED | Progressive streaming migration |
| **Phase 4** | ✅ COMPLETED | Optimization & production polish |

- **[phase3-testing.md](./phase3-testing.md)** - Testing guide for Phase 3 streaming migration

### Architecture Approach

We're using a **Notification-Driven REST** architecture with progressive enhancement:
1. Lightweight change notifications (not full data streaming)
2. REST APIs handle data fetching
3. Client refreshes intelligently based on notifications
4. Progressive migration to full streaming where beneficial

### Phase 1 Accomplishments (Completed 2025-08-11)

✅ **Infrastructure Created:**
- Firestore security rules for change collections
- Debounce utility for preventing notification spam
- Change detection triggers for groups and expenses
- Connection state manager for frontend
- Automatic cleanup of old notifications
- Full TypeScript support with error handling

✅ **Key Features:**
- ~100 Firestore reads/hour (minimal cost)
- 500ms debouncing for groups, 300ms for expenses
- Priority-based changes (high/medium/low)
- Connection quality monitoring
- Automatic cleanup every 5 minutes

### Phase 2 Accomplishments (Completed 2025-08-11)

✅ **Features Implemented:**
- Enhanced REST endpoints with metadata
- Smart client-side refresh logic
- Change detection subscription system
- User context preservation during updates
- Optimistic updates with conflict resolution
- Connection-aware refresh timing

✅ **Key Components:**
- `groups/handlers.ts` - Enhanced with metadata queries
- `change-detector.ts` - Firestore change subscription
- `groups-store-enhanced.ts` - Smart refresh & optimistic updates
- `firebase.ts` - Added Firestore support

### Phase 3 Accomplishments (Completed 2025-08-11)

✅ **Features Implemented:**
- Hybrid streaming architecture (metadata streams, expenses notify)
- Client-side balance calculation for <100 expenses
- Collaborative presence system with typing indicators
- Real-time animations for all updates
- Performance optimization and monitoring

✅ **Key Components:**
- `group-detail-store-enhanced.ts` - Hybrid streaming approach
- `balance-calculator.ts` - Client-side calculation with server fallback
- `presence-manager.ts` - Real-time collaboration features
- `animation-manager.ts` - Smooth update animations
- `PresenceIndicator.tsx` - Collaborative UI components

### Phase 4 Accomplishments (Completed 2025-08-11)

✅ **Features Implemented:**
- Performance optimization with intelligent update batching
- Advanced error handling with circuit breakers
- Comprehensive monitoring and analytics system
- Enhanced user experience with real-time indicators
- Environment-based configuration for deployment control

✅ **Key Components:**
- `performance-optimizer.ts` - Update batching and memory leak prevention
- `streaming-error-handler.ts` - Circuit breaker pattern with smart recovery
- `streaming-metrics.ts` - Hourly metrics collection and alerting
- `RealTimeIndicator.tsx` - Connection status with user feedback
- `ToastManager.tsx` - User notification system
- Environment variables and Firebase function deployment for gradual rollout

### Next Steps

**Production Deployment**
- Gradual rollout via Firebase function deployment (individual functions → full deployment)
- Real-world performance monitoring and optimization
- User feedback collection and analysis
- Continuous improvement based on metrics

### Testing

```bash
# Start emulator
npm run dev

# Test Phase 1 infrastructure
# See: phase1-testing.md

# Test Phase 2 smart refresh
# See: phase2-testing.md

# Test Phase 3 streaming migration
# See: phase3-testing.md

# Test Phase 4 production polish
# See: phase4-testing.md
```

### Cost Projections

- **Phase 1**: ~100 reads/hour per active user
- **Phase 2**: ~200 reads/hour per active user  
- **Phase 3**: ~300 reads/hour per active user
- **Phase 4**: <250 reads/hour per active user (optimized with batching)

### Rollback Strategy

Each phase is independently reversible:
- Phase 1: Disable listeners, no data loss
- Phase 2: Revert to original REST
- Phase 3: Disable streaming, keep REST updates
- Phase 4: Remove optimizations if issues arise
