# Streaming Implementation for Splitifyd

This directory contains all documentation and planning for implementing real-time streaming capabilities in Splitifyd.

## Overview

The streaming implementation follows a phased approach to progressively add real-time capabilities while maintaining system stability and controlling costs.

## Current Status

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | Core infrastructure & change detection |
| **Phase 2** | üîÑ Next | Smart REST with auto-refresh |
| **Phase 3** | ‚è≥ Planned | Progressive streaming migration |
| **Phase 4** | ‚è≥ Planned | Optimization & production polish |

### Planning Documents
- **[unified-plan.md](./unified-plan.md)** - Complete implementation plan with technical details for all phases
- **[phase1-testing.md](./phase1-testing.md)** - Testing guide for Phase 1 infrastructure

### Architecture Approach

We're using a **Notification-Driven REST** architecture with progressive enhancement:
1. Lightweight change notifications (not full data streaming)
2. REST APIs handle data fetching
3. Client refreshes intelligently based on notifications
4. Progressive migration to full streaming where beneficial

### Phase 1 Accomplishments (Completed 2025-08-11)

‚úÖ **Infrastructure Created:**
- Firestore security rules for change collections
- Debounce utility for preventing notification spam
- Change detection triggers for groups and expenses
- Connection state manager for frontend
- Automatic cleanup of old notifications
- Full TypeScript support with error handling

‚úÖ **Key Features:**
- ~100 Firestore reads/hour (minimal cost)
- 500ms debouncing for groups, 300ms for expenses
- Priority-based changes (high/medium/low)
- Connection quality monitoring
- Automatic cleanup every 5 minutes

### Next Steps

**Phase 2: Smart REST with Auto-Refresh**
- Implement paginated REST endpoints with metadata
- Add smart client-side refresh logic
- Preserve user context during updates
- Implement optimistic updates with conflict resolution

### Testing

To test Phase 1 infrastructure:
```bash
# Start emulator
npm run dev

# Follow testing guide
# See: phase1-testing.md
```

### Cost Projections

- **Phase 1**: ~100 reads/hour per active user
- **Phase 2**: ~200 reads/hour per active user  
- **Phase 3**: ~500 reads/hour for high-frequency data
- **Phase 4**: Optimized to <300 reads/hour total

### Rollback Strategy

Each phase is independently reversible:
- Phase 1: Disable listeners, no data loss
- Phase 2: Revert to original REST
- Phase 3: Disable streaming, keep REST updates
- Phase 4: Remove optimizations if issues arise
