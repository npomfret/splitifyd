# Firebase Code Review - Detailed Task List

This document outlines specific, actionable tasks based on the Firebase codebase code review.

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: The Firebase Functions codebase has critical technical debt in the balance calculation system that blocks most other improvements.

**Immediate Priority**: Task 1.1 (Balance Calculator Unit Tests) must be completed first to enable safe refactoring and type safety improvements.

**Key Insight**: The `calculateGroupBalances()` function is 265 lines of critical business logic with no tests and heavy `any` type usage. This represents significant business risk and blocks architectural improvements.

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Unit Testing for Balance Calculator

**STATUS: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** 
**PRIORITY: IMMEDIATE** - This blocks all refactoring and type safety improvements

#### Analysis Summary

**Current State:**
- `calculateGroupBalances()` is a 265-line monolithic function in `firebase/functions/src/services/balanceCalculator.ts`
- Contains critical business logic for expense splitting, settlement processing, and debt optimization
- Heavy use of `any` types (8 instances) making it error-prone and hard to refactor safely
- No unit tests exist - this is **HIGH RISK** for such critical business logic
- Function performs multiple complex operations: data fetching, expense processing, settlement reconciliation, balance calculation, and debt simplification
- Multi-currency support with complex nested data structures

**Why This Must Be First:**
- **Refactoring blocker**: Cannot safely break down this function without tests
- **Type safety blocker**: Cannot remove `any` types without tests to catch regressions  
- **High business risk**: Balance calculations affect money - bugs here are critical
- **Code complexity**: 265 lines with nested loops, state mutations, and complex logic

**Testing Infrastructure Status:**
- ✅ Jest configured and working (`firebase/functions/package.json`)
- ✅ Existing test structure in `src/__tests__/unit/`
- ✅ Good test examples in `debtSimplifier.test.ts` showing proper patterns
- ✅ Builder pattern examples available (follows project guidelines)

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Create comprehensive unit tests for `balanceCalculator.ts`

**Detailed Implementation Plan:**

1. **Test Infrastructure Setup** (Est: 2-3 hours)
   - Create `src/__tests__/unit/balanceCalculator.test.ts`
   - Set up Firestore mocking utilities for `db.collection()` calls
   - Create builder pattern classes for test data:
     - `ExpenseBuilder` - for creating test expense data
     - `SettlementBuilder` - for creating test settlement data  
     - `GroupBuilder` - for creating test group data with members
     - `UserProfileBuilder` - for creating test user profiles

2. **Core Function Testing** (Est: 4-5 hours)
   - **Empty/Edge Cases:**
     - Empty group (no members)
     - Group with members but no expenses
     - Group with members but no settlements
     - Invalid group ID (group not found)
     - Malformed group data (missing `data.members`)
   
   - **Single Currency Scenarios:**
     - Two users, one expense, equal split
     - Two users, one expense, unequal split  
     - Multiple users, single expense
     - Multiple users, multiple expenses
     - Complex scenario with expenses and settlements
   
   - **Multi-Currency Scenarios:**
     - Expenses in different currencies (USD, EUR)
     - Settlements in different currencies
     - Mixed currency transactions

3. **Settlement Logic Testing** (Est: 3-4 hours)
   - Settlement reduces existing debt correctly
   - Settlement overpayment creates reverse debt
   - Settlement between users with no prior debt
   - Settlement amount precision (0.01 threshold handling)
   - Multiple settlements between same users

4. **Data Structure Validation** (Est: 2-3 hours)
   - Required fields validation (currency, paidBy, splits)
   - Response structure matches `GroupBalance` interface
   - `balancesByCurrency` structure correctness
   - `userBalances` population from first currency
   - `simplifiedDebts` integration with debt simplifier

5. **Integration Points** (Est: 2-3 hours)
   - Mock `userService.getUsers()` calls
   - Mock Firestore query results
   - Verify proper error handling and propagation
   - Test interaction with `simplifyDebts()` utility

**Expected Test Coverage:**
- Target: >95% line coverage
- Focus: All branches, error conditions, edge cases
- Mock Strategy: Full Firestore isolation, real business logic
- Test Count Estimate: 25-30 comprehensive test cases

**Dependencies to Mock:**
- `db.collection(FirestoreCollections.EXPENSES).where().get()`
- `db.collection(FirestoreCollections.SETTLEMENTS).where().get()`  
- `db.collection(FirestoreCollections.GROUPS).doc().get()`
- `userService.getUsers(memberIds)`
- `simplifyDebts()` utility (spy/verify calls)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All edge cases covered with clear test names
- [ ] >95% code coverage achieved
- [ ] All `any` types have corresponding test assertions
- [ ] Test data uses builder pattern (per project guidelines)
- [ ] Tests run in <5 seconds (per project performance standards)
- [ ] No Firestore dependencies - fully mocked
- [ ] Tests pass consistently (no flaky behavior)

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Add unit tests for expense calculation logic
  - Test expense splitting algorithms
  - Test different split types (equal, exact amounts, percentages)
  - Test validation of expense data

- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Add unit tests for settlement calculation logic
  - Test settlement creation and validation
  - Test settlement impact on balances
  - Test settlement reversal scenarios

### 2. Balance Calculator Refactoring

**STATUS: BLOCKED BY TASK 1.1** 
**PRIORITY: HIGH** - Should follow immediately after unit tests are complete

#### Current Issues Identified:

**Type Safety Problems:**
- 8 instances of `any` type usage at lines: 18, 31, 42, 71, 87, 248, 252
- Most critical: `expenses` and `settlements` arrays typed as `any[]`
- Complex nested structures lack proper TypeScript interfaces
- Return type `GroupBalance` exists but internal structures are untyped

**Architectural Problems:**
- Single 265-line function doing too many things:
  - Database querying (3 separate collections)
  - Data validation and transformation  
  - Multi-currency expense processing
  - Settlement reconciliation logic
  - Balance calculation and aggregation
  - Debt simplification integration
- Nested loops with complex state mutations
- Mixed concerns: data access, business logic, and formatting

**Refactoring Strategy (MUST wait for tests):**

- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Break down `calculateGroupBalances` into smaller functions
  
  **Proposed Function Extraction:**
  ```typescript
  // 1. Data fetching layer
  async fetchGroupData(groupId: string): Promise<GroupData>
  async fetchExpensesForGroup(groupId: string): Promise<Expense[]>  
  async fetchSettlementsForGroup(groupId: string): Promise<Settlement[]>
  
  // 2. Processing layer
  processExpensesByUser(expenses: Expense[]): UserBalanceMap
  applySettlementsToBalances(balances: UserBalanceMap, settlements: Settlement[]): void
  calculateNetBalances(balances: UserBalanceMap): UserBalanceMap
  
  // 3. Formatting layer  
  formatBalanceResponse(data: ProcessedData): GroupBalance
  ```

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Remove all `any` types from `balanceCalculator.ts`

  **Required Type Definitions:**
  ```typescript
  interface Expense {
    id: string;
    groupId: string;
    paidBy: string;
    currency: string;
    splits: ExpenseSplit[];
    deletedAt?: Timestamp;
  }
  
  interface Settlement {
    id: string;
    groupId: string;
    payerId: string;
    payeeId: string; 
    amount: number;
    currency: string;
  }
  
  interface ExpenseSplit {
    userId: string;
    amount: number;
  }
  
  interface GroupData {
    id: string;
    data: {
      members: Record<string, GroupMember>;
    };
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Create proper interfaces for balance calculation
  
  **Additional Interfaces Needed:**
  ```typescript
  interface BalanceCalculationInput {
    groupId: string;
    expenses: Expense[];
    settlements: Settlement[];
    memberProfiles: Map<string, UserProfile>;
  }
  
  interface BalanceCalculationResult extends GroupBalance {
    // Inherits from existing GroupBalance interface
  }
  
  interface UserBalanceMap {
    [currency: string]: Record<string, UserBalance>;
  }
  
  interface ProcessingContext {
    groupId: string;
    currencies: Set<string>;
    memberIds: string[];
  }
  ```

**Benefits of Refactoring:**
- **Testability**: Each function can be unit tested independently

## Additional Work Items from AI Code Review

The following items were identified during an automated code review and should be integrated into the task list above.

### New High Priority Task: Fix Ineffective Rate Limiter
- [ ] **Task**: Replace the in-memory rate limiter with a distributed solution.
  - **Justification**: The current `InMemoryRateLimiter` is ineffective in a serverless environment as state is not shared between function instances.
  - **Action**: Implement rate limiting using Firestore to track request counts and timestamps per user.
  - **Testing**: Create unit tests for the new distributed rate limiter logic.

### New High Priority Task: Implement Denormalization for Performance
- [ ] **Task**: Implement denormalization for group summary data to fix N+1 query problem.
  - **Justification**: The `listGroups` endpoint is highly inefficient, making numerous database calls per group.
  - **Action**: Use existing Firestore triggers (`trackGroupChanges`, `trackExpenseChanges`) to pre-calculate and store summary data (like balances and last activity) directly on the group documents.
  - **Action**: Refactor the `listGroups` handler to read this pre-calculated data, removing the on-demand calculations.

### New Medium Priority Task: Data Access & Schema Refactoring
- [ ] **Task**: Implement a Repository Pattern for Firestore access.
  - **Justification**: Data access logic is currently scattered in handlers, making it hard to maintain.
  - **Action**: Create repositories (e.g., `GroupsRepository`) responsible for all read/write operations for each collection.
  - **Action**: Refactor handlers and services to use repositories instead of accessing `db.collection(...)` directly.
- [ ] **Task**: Flatten the Firestore document schema for groups.
  - **Justification**: The nested `data` object in group documents is awkward and adds unnecessary complexity.
  - **Action**: Remove the nested `data` object and update the data access layer to reflect the new, simpler schema.
