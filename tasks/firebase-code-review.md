# Firebase Code Review - A New Plan for Refactoring

## Executive Summary

**Previous Approach**: A large-scale, "big bang" refactoring was attempted to introduce a service layer for all application domains (groups, expenses, users, etc.) at once. This resulted in widespread test failures and made it difficult to isolate the root causes.

**New Approach**: We will adopt an incremental and iterative approach to refactoring. We will introduce the service layer one domain at a time, with a strong emphasis on writing and updating tests at each stage. This will allow us to make progress in smaller, safer, and more manageable steps.

## Guiding Principles

- **Incremental Changes**: Each change will be small and focused on a single piece of functionality.
- **Test-Driven**: We will write unit tests for the new service layer components _before_ or _during_ the refactoring of the handlers. Existing integration tests will be updated and must pass after each step.
- **Frequent Commits**: Each small, successful step will be committed, creating a clear history of the refactoring process.
- **No Broken Windows**: The `main` branch will always be in a state where all tests are passing.
