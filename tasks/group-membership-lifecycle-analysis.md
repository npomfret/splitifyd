# Group Membership Lifecycle Analysis and Recommendations

## 1. Overview

This document analyzes the current lifecycle of group membership in the application, confirms how it works, identifies critical bugs and missing features, and provides recommendations for improvement.

**CRITICAL UPDATE**: A severe security bug has been discovered that allows expenses to be created with invalid user IDs, resulting in "Unknown User" displays.

## 2. Current State of Group Membership

A thorough review of the codebase confirms the following ways a user's membership in a group can change.

### Group Creation

-   **Finding:** When a group is created, only the user who creates it is added as a member.
-   **Design Consideration:** There are two perspectives on this behavior:
    - **As Intended Design:** Groups are designed to start with only the creator as the sole member, with share links as the sole mechanism for adding members.
    - **As Bug:** The `sanitizeGroupData` function in `firebase/functions/src/groups/validation.ts` fails to copy the `members` array from the incoming request, preventing members from being added during creation.

### Adding New Members

-   **Finding:** The only way to add a new member to a group is via a shareable link.
-   **Implementation:** The `joinGroupByLink` function in `firebase/functions/src/groups/shareHandlers.ts` handles this functionality. No other methods for adding members (e.g., direct invite, admin adding a user) are currently implemented.

### Leaving or Being Removed from a Group

-   **Finding:** This functionality is **not implemented**.
-   **Reason:** As confirmed in the `e2e-test-gap-analysis.md` document, there are no backend APIs or frontend UI components that allow a user to leave a group or an admin to remove a member.

## 3. Summary of Issues

### CRITICAL SECURITY BUG: Invalid User IDs in Expenses

**Finding:** Expenses can be created with `paidBy` or `participants` containing user IDs that are NOT members of the group. This results in "Unknown User" being displayed in the UI.

**Root Cause:** The expense creation handler (`firebase/functions/src/expenses/handlers.ts`) does NOT validate that:
- The `paidBy` user ID exists in the group's `memberIds` array
- All user IDs in the `participants` array exist in the group's `memberIds` array

**Impact:**
- Users see "Unknown User" in expense displays when the user ID doesn't match any group member
- This occurs in multiple UI locations:
  - `ExpenseItem.tsx` line 44: Shows "Unknown" for paidBy user
  - `MembersList.tsx`: Shows "Unknown User" for unmatched members
  - `SettlementForm.tsx`: Shows "Unknown User" in settlements
  - `SplitBreakdown.tsx`: Shows "Unknown" in expense split details

**How This Can Happen:**
1. Malicious or buggy API calls could send arbitrary user IDs
2. Old code paths might allow non-member IDs to be submitted
3. Data corruption or migration issues could introduce invalid IDs

### Other Issues

1.  **Group Creation Behavior:** The `sanitizeGroupData` function doesn't copy the `members` array during group creation. This is either:
    - A bug preventing intended functionality of adding multiple members at creation time, OR
    - Intentional design where share links are the sole mechanism for adding members
2.  **Missing Core Feature:** The lack of a "leave group" or "remove member" feature is a significant gap in the application's core functionality.

## 4. Recommendations

### P0 - CRITICAL: Fix Invalid User ID Bug in Expenses âœ… IMPLEMENTED

**STATUS: COMPLETED** - This security fix has been successfully implemented on 2025-08-13.

**Implementation Summary:**
- Added `verifyUsersInGroup` function to validate all user IDs are group members
- Updated `createExpense` to validate paidBy and participants before creation
- Updated `updateExpense` to validate users when participants or paidBy change
- Tests updated and passing

This security bug has been fixed to prevent invalid data from entering the system.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added `verifyUsersInGroup` function (line 72-98):**
   - Validates that all specified user IDs are members of the group
   - Includes both group owner and all members in validation
   - Throws clear error messages for invalid users

2. **Updated `createExpense` function (lines 163-166):**
   - Added validation after fetching group members
   - Validates both paidBy and all participants before creating expense

3. **Updated `updateExpense` function (lines 300-315):**
   - Added validation when participants or paidBy are being updated
   - Ensures all users are valid group members before allowing update

4. **Test Updates:**
   - Fixed integration tests that were attempting to use non-members
   - All expense tests now passing with the security validation in place

**Note:** The settlements feature already had proper validation via a similar `verifyUsersInGroup` function, and the expense handlers now follow the same secure pattern.

### P0/P1 - Address Group Creation Member Handling

Depending on the intended design:

**Option A: If members during creation is a desired feature:**
Fix the `sanitizeGroupData` function in `firebase/functions/src/groups/validation.ts`:

```typescript
export const sanitizeGroupData = <T extends CreateGroupRequest | UpdateGroupRequest>(data: T): T => {
  const sanitized: any = {};
  
  if ('name' in data && data.name) {
    sanitized.name = sanitizeString(data.name);
  }
  
  if ('description' in data && data.description !== undefined) {
    sanitized.description = sanitizeString(data.description);
  }
  
  // Add this block to preserve the members array
  if ('members' in data && data.members) {
    sanitized.members = data.members;
  }
  
  return sanitized as T;
};
```

**Option B: If share links are the sole intended mechanism:**
Remove unused code paths for clarity:
1.  Remove `members` field from `CreateGroupRequest` interface
2.  Remove `members` validation from the create group schema
3.  Document that share links are the only way to add members

### P1 - High Priority: Implement Member Management Features âœ… IMPLEMENTED

**STATUS: COMPLETED** - Leave and remove functionality has been successfully implemented on 2025-08-13.

**Implementation Summary:**
1. **Backend Endpoints:**
   - `POST /groups/:id/leave` - Allows users to voluntarily leave a group
   - `DELETE /groups/:id/members/:memberId` - Allows group creators to remove members
   
2. **Security & Business Logic:**
   - Balance checking prevents leaving/removal with outstanding balance
   - Group creators cannot leave (must transfer ownership or delete group)
   - Only group creators can remove other members
   - Cannot remove the group creator

3. **Frontend Implementation:**
   - Added leave/remove buttons to MembersList component
   - Integrated with GroupDetailPage with confirmation dialogs
   - Auto-refresh of member list and balances after removal
   - Different UI for creators (remove buttons) vs members (leave button)

**Files Modified:**
- Backend: `memberHandlers.ts`, `index.ts`
- Frontend: `apiClient.ts`, `group-detail-store.ts`, `MembersList.tsx`, `GroupDetailPage.tsx`

## Implementation Status
