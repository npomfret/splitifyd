# Group Membership Lifecycle Analysis

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-19

## Status Summary

| Issue | Priority | Status | Resolution |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| Invalid User IDs in Expenses | P0 | ✅ FIXED | Added validation to ensure only group members can be in expenses |
| Group Creation Members | P1 | ✅ WORKING | `sanitizeGroupData` already handles members array correctly |
| Leave/Remove Member | P1 | ✅ EXISTS | Already implemented with balance checks |

## Completed Work

### 1. Fixed Security Bug: Invalid User IDs in Expenses
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `expenses/handlers.ts`: Added member validation in create/update
  - `expenses/validation.ts`: Added paidBy to update schema
  - Added comprehensive test coverage
- **Impact**: Prevents "Unknown User" displays in UI

### 2. Verified Existing Features
- Group creation properly handles members array
- Leave group (`POST /groups/:id/leave`) - implemented with balance checks
- Remove member (`DELETE /groups/:id/members/:memberId`) - owner only, with balance checks
- Frontend components already use these endpoints

## Remaining Work

### P0: Add Missing Joi Validation (Security Risk) - COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-08-19)

**Resolution**: 
All user and policy handlers now use proper Joi validation schemas instead of direct `req.body` destructuring or type assertions.

**Files Created**:
- `user/validation.ts` - Joi schemas for updateUserProfile and deleteUser
- `policies/validation.ts` - Joi schemas for acceptPolicy and acceptMultiplePolicies

**Files Updated**:
- `user/handlers.ts` - Now uses validateUpdateUserProfile and validateDeleteUser
- `policies/user-handlers.ts` - Now uses validateAcceptPolicy and validateAcceptMultiplePolicies

**Tests Added**:
- Extended `user-profile.test.ts` with Joi validation tests
- Created `policy-validation.test.ts` with comprehensive validation tests
- All tests passing

### P1: Fix Real-Time UI Update Reliability

**Problem**: Real-time updates are implemented but not working reliably. E2E tests still require `page.reload()` calls with comments stating "Real-time updates are not fully implemented yet".

**Current State**: 
- ChangeDetector class already uses Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners
- Change collections (GROUP_CHANGES, TRANSACTION_CHANGES, BALANCE_CHANGES) trigger refreshes
- System has retry logic and error handling
- **But updates are unreliable in practice**

**Required Actions**:
1. Debug why existing real-time listeners are not working consistently
2. Fix timing/race conditions in change detection system
3. Remove `page.reload()` calls from E2E tests once reliable
4. Improve error handling for offline/connection issues

**Affected Areas**:
- E2E tests (currently have workaround reloads)
- Group updates (name, description, members)  
- Expense creation/updates
- Balance changes
- Settlements

### P2: Documentation Cleanup

- Remove outdated TODO comments
- Update API documentation with new error codes
- Archive completed task documents

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Fix validation gap (security issue) - ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Next Sprint**: Fix real-time update reliability (UX improvement) - 1-2 days  
3. **When Time Permits**: Documentation cleanup - 2-3 hours
