# Task: Webapp-v2 Hardening & Cleanup

## Focus
Last remaining hardening item: simplify `enhancedGroupsStore` and `enhancedGroupDetailStore` by teasing apart pagination, realtime, and auxiliary responsibilities.

## Plan
1. ✅ Introduced helper modules for the groups store (pagination controller, error manager, realtime coordinator) without altering the public API.
2. ✅ Refactored `enhancedGroupsStore` to compose the helpers, encapsulating pagination, realtime wiring, and error handling.
3. ✅ Added analogous helpers for the group-detail store (collection manager, realtime coordinator, side-effect wrapper).
4. ✅ Refactored `enhancedGroupDetailStore` to lean on the helpers, keeping core state updates concise and readable.
5. ✅ Extended unit coverage for each helper and reran the webapp build + unit suites.
