# Task: Encapsulate Firestore Reads into a Centralized Service

## 1. Analysis & Critique

### 1.1. Merit Assessment

**✅ Strong Benefits:**
- **Testability Revolution**: Eliminates complex Firebase emulator dependency for unit tests
- **Type Safety**: Centralized Zod validation ensures consistent data schemas
- **ServiceRegistry Integration**: Aligns perfectly with existing dependency injection pattern
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for all read queries
- **Performance Opportunities**: Centralized caching, query optimization, batching

**✅ Architectural Soundness:**
- Follows dependency inversion principle
- Leverages existing `ServiceRegistry` infrastructure
- Maintains separation of concerns
- Compatible with current Zod schema validation patterns

### 1.2. Critical Analysis & Concerns

**⚠️ Scope Complexity:**
- **29 files** with Firestore reads require refactoring
- **Mixed concerns**: Some files have both read/write operations
- **Real-time listeners**: Complex subscription management patterns
- **Transaction contexts**: Some reads must occur within Firestore transactions

**⚠️ Testing Migration Risk:**
- **All integration tests** rely on emulator setup
- **TestUserPoolService** extensively uses direct Firestore calls
- **Test builders** (`CreateGroupRequestBuilder`, etc.) may need updates
- **Timing/race conditions** in real-time features

**⚠️ Interface Design Challenges:**
- **Query complexity**: Some reads have complex where clauses, pagination
- **Permission contexts**: Many reads require user permission checking
- **Performance patterns**: Existing services optimize specific query patterns
- **Return type consistency**: Services return different shapes (raw docs vs. transformed objects)

## 2. Revised Architecture Design

### 2.1. Core Interface Structure

```typescript
// Core read interface with consistent patterns
interface IFirestoreReader {
    // Document reads - consistent null return for missing docs
    getUser(userId: string): Promise<UserProfile | null>;
    getGroup(groupId: string): Promise<Group | null>;
    getExpense(expenseId: string): Promise<Expense | null>;
    getSettlement(settlementId: string): Promise<Settlement | null>;
    getPolicy(policyId: string): Promise<Policy | null>;

    // Collection reads - consistent array returns
    getUsersForGroup(groupId: string): Promise<UserProfile[]>;
    getGroupsForUser(userId: string): Promise<Group[]>;
    getExpensesForGroup(groupId: string, options?: PaginationOptions): Promise<Expense[]>;
    getSettlementsForGroup(groupId: string): Promise<Settlement[]>;
    
    // Complex queries with options
    getGroupMembers(groupId: string, options?: { 
        includeInactive?: boolean; 
        roles?: MemberRole[] 
    }): Promise<GroupMemberDocument[]>;
    
    // Search and filtering
    getActiveShareLinkByToken(token: string): Promise<ShareLink | null>;
    getCommentsForTarget(targetType: 'group' | 'expense', targetId: string): Promise<Comment[]>;
    
    // Real-time subscriptions - return unsubscribe functions
    subscribeToGroup(groupId: string, callback: (group: Group | null) => void): () => void;
    subscribeToGroupExpenses(groupId: string, callback: (expenses: Expense[]) => void): () => void;
}

// Supporting types for consistency
interface PaginationOptions {
    limit?: number;
    offset?: number;
    cursor?: string;
}
```

### 2.2. Implementation with Validation & Error Handling

```typescript
export class FirestoreReader implements IFirestoreReader {
    constructor(
        private db: FirebaseFirestore.Firestore = firestoreDb,
        private logger: LoggerContext = logger
    ) {}

    public async getUser(userId: string): Promise<UserProfile | null> {
        try {
            const userDoc = await this.db.collection(FirestoreCollections.USERS)
                .doc(userId)
                .get();
                
            if (!userDoc.exists) {
                return null;
            }
            
            // Validate with existing schemas
            const userData = UserDocumentSchema.parse({
                id: userDoc.id,
                ...userDoc.data()
            });
            
            return userData;
        } catch (error) {
            this.logger.error(`Failed to get user ${userId}:`, error);
            throw error;
        }
    }
    
    // Transaction-aware reads for complex operations
    public async getGroupInTransaction(
        transaction: FirebaseFirestore.Transaction,
        groupId: string
    ): Promise<Group | null> {
        const groupRef = this.db.collection(FirestoreCollections.GROUPS).doc(groupId);
        const groupDoc = await transaction.get(groupRef);
        
        if (!groupDoc.exists) {
            return null;
        }
        
        return GroupDocumentSchema.parse({
            id: groupDoc.id,
            ...groupDoc.data()
        });
    }
}
```

### 2.3. Mock Implementation for Testing

```typescript
export class MockFirestoreReader implements IFirestoreReader {
    // Auto-generated mock functions with proper typing
    public getUser = vi.fn<[string], Promise<UserProfile | null>>();
    public getGroup = vi.fn<[string], Promise<Group | null>>();
    public getExpense = vi.fn<[string], Promise<Expense | null>>();
    // ... all other methods
    
    // Test utilities
    public resetAllMocks(): void {
        vi.resetAllMocks();
    }
    
    // Helper for common test scenarios
    public mockUserExists(userId: string, userData: Partial<UserProfile>): void {
        this.getUser.mockImplementation(async (id) => 
            id === userId ? { uid: userId, ...userData } as UserProfile : null
        );
    }
}

### Phase 2: Service Migration (Days 4-10) 

#### Service Migration Order (Risk-based)

**Day 4: UserService2 (Foundation)** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Why first**: Used by authentication, most critical
- **Complexity**: Low - mostly simple document gets
- **Impact**: High - affects all authenticated endpoints
- **Tests**: 5 test files affected

**Implementation Results:**
- ✅ Updated UserService2 constructor to accept IFirestoreReader dependency
- ✅ Replaced 2 direct Firestore calls (`firestoreDb.collection().doc().get()`) with `firestoreReader.getUser()`
- ✅ Updated ServiceRegistry to inject IFirestoreReader into UserService2
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit test suite with MockFirestoreReader (9 tests)
- ✅ Removed Zod validation from UserService2 (now handled by FirestoreReader)

- ✅ All integration tests passing: 524/524
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

**Day 5: GroupService (Core Business Logic)** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Why second**: Central to app functionality
- **Complexity**: Medium - some complex queries with pagination
- **Impact**: High - affects most app features
- **Tests**: 8 test files affected

**Implementation Results:**
- ✅ Updated GroupService constructor to accept IFirestoreReader dependency
- ✅ Replaced 6 direct Firestore calls with reader methods:
  - `fetchGroupWithAccess`: getGroup() call
  - `batchFetchGroupData`: getExpensesForGroup() and getSettlementsForGroup() calls  
  - `_executeListGroups`: getGroupsForUser() call
  - `deleteGroup`: getExpensesForGroup() call
  - `_getGroupBalances`: getGroup() call
- ✅ Updated ServiceRegistry to inject IFirestoreReader into GroupService
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit test suite with MockFirestoreReader (8 tests)

- ✅ **Code Quality**: Proper error handling, logging, and type safety maintained throughout

**⚠️ IDENTIFIED GAP - Scale Testing Requirements:**
The current FirestoreReader integration tests (5 tests) are basic functionality tests that don't cover scale scenarios. Based on the subcollection architecture and potential for large datasets, we need comprehensive scale testing:

**Missing Test Coverage:**
- **Users with many groups** (100+, 1000+ groups) - tests pagination limits, query performance 
- **Groups with many members** (50+, 500+ members) - tests subcollection performance
- **Groups with many comments** (100+, 1000+ comments) - tests comment retrieval efficiency
- **Groups with many settlements** (100+, 1000+ settlements) - tests settlement queries
- **Groups with many expenses** (500+, 5000+ expenses) - tests expense pagination
- **Complex pagination scenarios** - cursor edge cases, ordering with large datasets
- **Concurrent access patterns** - multiple users querying same large groups
- **Memory usage validation** - ensure large result sets don't cause memory issues

**Action Item**: Create `firestore-reader.scale.integration.test.ts` with load testing for:
1. **Pagination stress testing** - verify cursor logic works with 10,000+ groups
2. **Subcollection performance** - test group member lookups with large member lists  
3. **Query optimization validation** - ensure 'in' query batching handles limits correctly
4. **Memory boundary testing** - validate behavior with result sets near memory limits

**Risk**: Without scale testing, the subcollection architecture changes could cause performance issues or pagination failures in production with large datasets.

**⚠️ CRITICAL PERFORMANCE CONCERN - Pagination Implementation:**
The current FirestoreReader.getGroupsForUser() implementation has a fundamental performance flaw:

**Current Approach Issues:**
1. **Fetches ALL user groups** from subcollections (potentially thousands)
2. **Sorts in memory** instead of using Firestore indexes
3. **Applies pagination in-memory** using array slicing
4. **No query limits** on the initial subcollection fetch

**Performance Impact:**
- User with 1000+ groups: fetches ALL 1000 groups just to return first 10
- Memory usage scales linearly with total group count (not page size)
- Network bandwidth wasted transferring unused data
- CPU overhead for client-side sorting and pagination
- Firestore read costs for ALL documents regardless of page size

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. **Redesign pagination** to use proper Firestore cursor-based pagination
2. **Apply limits at query level**, not in memory
3. **Use Firestore ordering** instead of client-side sorting  
4. **Batch subcollection queries** with proper limits
5. **Implement cursor state management** for reliable pagination

**Current Implementation Risk**: Production systems with users having 100+ groups will experience:
- Slow response times (fetching unnecessary data)
- High memory usage (storing all groups in memory)  
- Expensive Firestore costs (reading all documents)
- Poor user experience (pagination delays)

This pagination performance issue should be prioritized as **HIGH PRIORITY** for the next development cycle.

**Day 7: GroupMemberService & GroupPermissionService** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Why paired**: Related functionality, complex permission logic

- **Tests**: Core unit tests created (tests pass for isolated functionality, some integration issues with service registry in test environment)

**Day 8: Support Services (CommentService, GroupShareService)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Why paired**: Related secondary functionality with straightforward query patterns  
- **Complexity**: Low-medium - straightforward collection queries
- **Impact**: Low-medium - secondary features
- **Tests**: 2 unit test files created, existing integration tests maintained
- **Status**: Migration complete, both services now use IFirestoreReader dependency injection

**Day 10: Policy & Validation Services**
- **Why last**: Less frequently used, simpler patterns
- **Complexity**: Low - mostly document gets
- **Impact**: Low - configuration/validation features
- **Tests**: 2 test files affected

### Phase 3: Infrastructure & Handlers (Days 11-13)

#### Day 11: Authentication & Middleware
**Files:**
- `auth/middleware.ts` - user authentication reads
- `auth/handlers.ts` - authentication endpoint reads  
- `auth/policy-helpers.ts` - policy helper functions

**Approach:**
- Inject `IFirestoreReader` into middleware functions

5. **Simplify Development**: Clear, consistent interface for all database reads

The 18-day implementation plan balances thorough execution with manageable risk, ensuring each phase can be completed successfully while maintaining system stability.

## 8. Future Architecture Requirements

### 8.1. IFirestoreWriter - Centralized Write Operations

**User Requirement (identified during Day 7):** We need a FirestoreWriter service whose job is to ensure documents going into Firestore adhere to our schemas.

**Key Design Considerations:**
1. **Schema Validation**: All writes must pass through Zod validation before hitting Firestore
2. **Transaction Support**: Should handle Firestore transactions with proper retries
3. **Optimistic Locking**: Implement concurrent modification detection  
4. **Centralized Write Logic**: Single source of truth for all Firestore write operations
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and logging for all writes
6. **Performance**: Batch operations where possible to reduce Firestore costs

**Proposed Interface Structure:**
```typescript
interface IFirestoreWriter {
    // Document Operations
    createDocument<T>(collection: string, data: T, schema: z.ZodSchema<T>): Promise<string>;
    updateDocument<T>(collection: string, docId: string, updates: Partial<T>, schema: z.ZodSchema<T>): Promise<void>;
    deleteDocument(collection: string, docId: string): Promise<void>;
    
    // Transaction Operations
    runTransaction<T>(operation: (transaction: Transaction, writer: IFirestoreWriter) => Promise<T>): Promise<T>;
    
    // Batch Operations
    batchWrite(operations: WriteOperation[]): Promise<void>;
    
    // Subcollection Operations
    createSubcollectionDocument<T>(
        parentCollection: string, 
        parentDocId: string, 
        subcollection: string, 
        data: T, 
        schema: z.ZodSchema<T>
    ): Promise<string>;
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- Works alongside IFirestoreReader for complete database abstraction
- Services use both IFirestoreReader and IFirestoreWriter as dependencies
- Maintains existing ServiceRegistry integration pattern
- Provides MockFirestoreWriter for unit testing without emulator

**Benefits:**
1. **Schema Enforcement**: Impossible to write invalid data to Firestore
2. **Testability**: Complete write mocking for unit tests  
3. **Consistency**: All writes follow same patterns and error handling
4. **Performance**: Centralized location for write optimizations
5. **Maintainability**: Single place to update write logic and schema validation

**Priority**: HIGH - Should be implemented immediately after read encapsulation is complete

**Implementation Estimate**: 5-7 days (similar to IFirestoreReader implementation)

This would complete the full Firestore abstraction layer, giving us complete control over both reads and writes with full schema validation and excellent testability.
