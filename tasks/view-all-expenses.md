# Feature: View All Expenses

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view all my expenses in one place, so I can get a comprehensive overview of my spending across all my groups.

## Requirements

- **UI Element:** A button or link, labeled "View All Expenses", should be added to the main dashboard.
- **Navigation:** Clicking the "View All Expenses" button will navigate the user to a dedicated page displaying a comprehensive list of all their expenses.
- **Data Display:** The "All Expenses" page will show a chronological list of expenses from all of the user's groups.
- **Expense Details:** Each item in the list should clearly display:
    - Expense Description
    - Amount
    - Date
    - The group the expense belongs to
- **Functionality:**
    - **Search:** Users should be able to search for specific expenses by description.
    - **Filtering:** Users should be able to filter expenses by date range, expense category, and group.
    - **Pagination:** To ensure performance, the list of expenses will be paginated.

## Out of Scope

- Editing or deleting expenses directly from the "All Expenses" view. Users will need to navigate to the specific group to manage expenses.
- Advanced analytics or visualizations of the expense data.
