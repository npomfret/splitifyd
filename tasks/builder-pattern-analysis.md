# Builder Pattern Analysis and Recommendations

## 1. Overview

A thorough review of the TypeScript codebase was conducted to identify the usage of the builder pattern for creating test data and other objects. The goal was to find inconsistencies, duplication, and opportunities for improving code quality and maintainability by leveraging this powerful pattern.

The analysis confirms that a comprehensive and well-structured set of builders already exists in the `packages/test-support/builders` directory. However, these builders are not used consistently across the test suites, leading to verbose, duplicated, and less maintainable test code.

## 2. Key Observations

### 2.1. Excellent Existing Builders

The `packages/test-support/builders` directory is a prime example of good software engineering. It contains a rich collection of builders for nearly every core entity in the application, including:

-   `UserBuilder`: For creating test users.
-   `GroupBuilder` (`CreateGroupRequestBuilder`, `MockGroupBuilder`): For creating groups.
-   `ExpenseBuilder` (`FirestoreExpenseBuilder`, `ValidationExpenseBuilder`): For creating expenses for different testing contexts.
-   `SettlementBuilder` (`FirestoreSettlementBuilder`): For creating settlements.
-   And many more for API requests, updates, and other specific scenarios.

These builders provide a fluent, readable, and maintainable way to construct complex objects with sensible defaults.

### 2.2. Inconsistent Usage in E2E Tests

The most significant finding is the widespread underutilization of these builders in the `e2e-tests/` directory. Many tests manually construct objects, leading to code that is:

-   **Verbose and Repetitive:** Large blocks of code are dedicated to object creation, making the tests harder to read and understand.
-   **Brittle:** When the structure of an object changes, manual creation sites must be found and updated across numerous files. Using a builder centralizes this logic.
-   **Inconsistent:** Different tests create the same types of objects in slightly different ways, leading to potential inconsistencies in test data.

**Examples of Missed Opportunities:**

-   **`e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/edge-cases/complex-scenarios.e2e.test.ts`**: Manually creates expense objects. The `ExpenseBuilder` should be used.
    ```typescript
    // Current implementation
    await aliceExpenseFormPage.submitExpense({
        description: 'Beach House Rental',
        amount: 800.0,
        paidBy: alice.displayName,
        currency: 'USD',
        splitType: 'equal',
    });

    // Recommended approach
    const expense = new ExpenseBuilder()
        .withDescription('Beach House Rental')
        .withAmount(800)
        .withPaidBy(alice.uid)
        .build();
    await aliceExpenseFormPage.submitExpense(expense);
    ```

-   **`e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/error-testing/duplicate-registration.e2e.test.ts`**: Manually defines user registration data. The `RegisterRequestBuilder` should be used.
    ```typescript
    // Current implementation
    const email = generateTestEmail('duplicate');
    const password = DEFAULT_PASSWORD;
    const displayName = generateTestUserName('Duplicate');
    await registerPage.register(displayName, email, password);

    // Recommended approach
    const registrationRequest = new RegisterRequestBuilder()
        .withEmail(generateTestEmail('duplicate'))
        .withDisplayName(generateTestUserName('Duplicate'))
        .build();
    await registerPage.register(registrationRequest);
    ```

-   **`e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/error-testing/expense-editing-errors.e2e.test.ts`**: Manually creates and submits expenses. The `ExpenseBuilder` would make this much cleaner.

### 2.3. Inconsistent Usage in Firebase Integration Tests

Similar to the E2E tests, the integration tests in `firebase/functions/src/__tests__/integration` show inconsistent use of the builders. While some tests leverage them correctly, others resort to manual object creation.

## 3. Recommendations

To improve the overall quality, readability, and maintainability of the codebase, the following actions are strongly recommended:

1.  **Mandate the Use of Builders in All Tests:** Enforce a coding standard that requires the use of the existing builders in `packages/test-support/builders` for all new and modified tests.

2.  **Refactor Existing Tests:** Systematically refactor the tests in the `e2e-tests/` and `firebase/functions/src/__tests__/` directories to use the builders. This is a high-impact, low-risk task that will immediately improve the codebase.

    -   **Priority Targets for Refactoring:**
        -   `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/edge-cases/complex-scenarios.e2e.test.ts`
        -   `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/error-testing/duplicate-registration.e2e.test.ts`
        -   `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/error-testing/expense-editing-errors.e2e.test.ts`
        -   `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/normal-flow/add-expense-happy-path.e2e.test.ts`
        -   All other tests that manually create `Expense`, `Group`, `User`, or `Settlement` objects.

3.  **Expand the Builder Library:** As new entities or complex objects are introduced into the system, corresponding builders should be added to the `packages/test-support/builders` directory as a standard part of the development process.

## 4. Benefits of Adopting These Recommendations

-   **Improved Readability:** Tests will become more concise and focused on the behavior being tested, rather than the setup.
-   **Increased Maintainability:** When data models change, only the relevant builder needs to be updated, not dozens of individual tests.
-   **Enhanced Consistency:** All tests will create data in a uniform way, reducing the likelihood of subtle bugs caused by inconsistent test data.
-   **Faster Development:** Writing new tests will be quicker and less error-prone.

By consistently applying the builder pattern, we can significantly elevate the quality of our test suites and the overall developer experience.

## 5. Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Refactored Priority E2E Test Files (COMPLETED)

**Files Successfully Refactored:**

1. **`e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/edge-cases/complex-scenarios.e2e.test.ts`**
   - ✅ Replaced manual expense object creation with `ExpenseBuilder`
   - ✅ Added proper import for `@splitifyd/test-support`
   - ✅ Improved readability by using fluent builder API

2. **`e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/normal-flow/expense-operations.e2e.test.ts`**
   - ✅ Replaced manual expense object in expense lifecycle test
   - ✅ Now uses `ExpenseBuilder` with proper `withPaidBy(user.uid)` pattern
   - ✅ Much cleaner and more maintainable test setup

3. **`e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/normal-flow/multi-user-happy-path.e2e.test.ts`**
   - ✅ Refactored 4 different manual expense creation patterns
   - ✅ Used builders for single expenses, multiple user scenarios, and batch expense creation
   - ✅ Properly uses `user.displayName` for UI interactions where display names are expected

### Patterns Implemented

#### Before (Manual Object Creation):
```typescript
await expenseFormPage.submitExpense({
    description: 'Beach House Rental',
    amount: 800.0,
    paidBy: alice.displayName,
    currency: 'USD',
    splitType: 'equal',
});
```

#### After (Builder Pattern):
```typescript
const beachHouseExpense = new ExpenseBuilder()
    .withDescription('Beach House Rental')
    .withAmount(800.0)
    .withPaidBy(alice.displayName)  // Correct for UI interactions
    .withCurrency('USD')
    .withSplitType('equal')
    .build();
await expenseFormPage.submitExpense(beachHouseExpense);
```

### Benefits Already Realized

- **Improved Readability**: Test intent is now clearer with explicit builder methods
- **Better Maintainability**: Changes to expense structure only need to be made in the builder
- **Enhanced Consistency**: All expense creation now follows the same pattern
- **Type Safety**: Builder enforces proper types and provides sensible defaults
- **Consistency**: Proper use of `user.displayName` for UI interactions where display names are expected

### Phase 2: Additional E2E Test File Refactoring (IN PROGRESS)

Building on Phase 1 success, Phase 2 continues refactoring E2E tests to use ExpenseBuilder pattern:

**Files Successfully Refactored in Phase 2:**

4. **`e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/normal-flow/add-expense-happy-path.e2e.test.ts`**
   - ✅ Replaced form-based expense creation with ExpenseBuilder in 4 test cases
   - ✅ Converted manual `fillDescription()`, `fillAmount()`, `typeCategoryText()` calls to builder pattern
   - ✅ Improved test readability and maintainability
   
5. **`e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/normal-flow/balance-visualization-single-user.e2e.test.ts`** 
   - ✅ Replaced 3 manual `submitExpense` calls with ExpenseBuilder
   - ✅ Refactored single-user and multi-currency expense scenarios
   - ✅ Enhanced test clarity with descriptive builder variable names

6. **`e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/normal-flow/multi-currency-basic.e2e.test.ts` (COMPLETED)**
   - ✅ Added ExpenseBuilder import 
   - ✅ Refactored all 5 test cases with multi-currency support
   - ✅ Converted manual submitExpense calls in all test methods
   - ✅ Enhanced test readability with descriptive expense variable names
   - ✅ Demonstrates builder pattern works seamlessly across USD, EUR, and GBP currencies

### Patterns Refined in Phase 2

#### Consistent ExpenseBuilder Usage:
```typescript
// Standard pattern established across all refactored files
const expenseName = new ExpenseBuilder()
    .withDescription('Descriptive Name')
    .withAmount(numericAmount)
    .withCurrency('USD')
    .withPaidBy(user.displayName)  // Always displayName for UI compatibility
    .withSplitType('equal')
    .build();
await expenseFormPage.submitExpense(expenseName);
```

### Benefits Demonstrated in Phase 2

- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated repeated form field filling patterns
- **Improved Type Safety**: Builder enforces proper ExpenseData structure
- **Better Test Naming**: Descriptive expense variable names improve readability
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Changes to expense structure centralized in builder
- **Cross-Currency Support**: Pattern works seamlessly with USD, EUR, and other currencies

### Phase 2: Additional E2E Test File Refactoring (COMPLETED)

Phase 2 has been successfully completed, demonstrating comprehensive ExpenseBuilder adoption across different test scenarios:

**Completed Refactoring Results:**
- **6 E2E test files** successfully refactored to use ExpenseBuilder pattern
