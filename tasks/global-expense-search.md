# Global Expense Search

## Feature Description

Implement a global search tool that allows users to search for any expense across all groups they are a member of. The search should be fast and typo-tolerant.

## Search Fields

The search should cover the following fields:

- Expense description
- Expense amount
- Expense category
- Notes

## Implementation Considerations

- **Firestore Limitations:** Firestore does not support native full-text search.
- **Third-Party Search Service:** To implement this feature, we will need to use a third-party search service.
- **Recommended Service:** Given prior experience, **Typesense** is the recommended solution. It is an open-source, typo-tolerant search engine that can be self-hosted or used via a managed service. It integrates well with Firebase via an extension.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A search bar is prominently displayed on the main dashboard.
- Users can type a search query and see results in real-time.
- Search results should be relevant and ranked appropriately.
- Clicking on a search result should navigate the user to the expense detail view.
