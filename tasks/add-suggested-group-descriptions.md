# Feature: Suggested Group Descriptions

## Overview

To make group creation faster and more intuitive, this feature will introduce a list of suggested descriptions that appear when a user focuses on the description field. These suggestions provide common use-cases, helping users categorize their groups quickly.

## UI/UX Changes

- **Trigger:** When a user clicks on or tabs to the "Description" input field within the "Create Group" modal, a dropdown list of suggestions will appear directly below it.
- **Interaction:**
    - Clicking a suggestion from the list will instantly populate the description field with the selected text.
    - The list of suggestions will disappear after a selection is made or if the user clicks away from the field.
    - Users can still ignore the suggestions and type a completely custom description.
