## Task: High-Level Plan for Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)

**Goal:**
Prepare the entire application codebase to support multiple languages, enabling future translation and localization efforts.

**Justification:**
To expand our user base globally, the app must be able to display all text and content in the user's native language. This task outlines the foundational work required to make the app translatable.

### High-Level Considerations

This is a high-level overview of the areas and concepts we need to address. A detailed technical analysis will be required for each point.

#### 1. String Externalization (The Core Task)

- **Concept:** No user-facing text should be hardcoded directly in the source code. Every string (e.g., "Add Expense", "Welcome back!", "Your email is invalid") must be moved into separate language resource files (e.g., JSON files).
- **Action:** A full audit of the codebase is needed to find and replace all hardcoded strings with a key that references an entry in a language file.

#### 2. Choosing an i18n Framework

- **Concept:** We need to select and integrate a dedicated library to manage the complexities of translation.
- **Considerations:** The framework should handle:
    - Loading the correct language files.
    - Looking up translation keys.
    - **Pluralization:** Handling different strings for singular vs. plural counts (e.g., "1 item" vs. "5 items"), which varies by language.
    - **Interpolation:** Injecting dynamic values into strings (e.g., `Hello, {username}!`).
- **Examples:** `react-i18next`, `i18next`, `FormatJS (React Intl)`.

#### 3. Key Areas for String Extraction

We need to audit the following areas across the entire project (both frontend and backend):

- **Frontend (WebApp):**
    - All UI components (buttons, labels, titles, tooltips, placeholders).
    - Static page content.
    - Form validation messages.
    - Client-side error messages and toasts/notifications.
- **Backend (Firebase Functions):**
    - API error messages returned to the client.
    - Email templates (e.g., welcome emails, password resets).
    - Push notifications.

#### 4. Handling Localized Formatting

- **Concept:** Internationalization is more than just translating text. Different regions have different conventions.
- **Considerations:**
    - **Dates & Times:** `MM/DD/YYYY` (US) vs. `DD/MM/YYYY` (Europe).
    - **Numbers & Currency:** `1,000.50` (US) vs. `1.000,50` (Germany). Currency symbols also change position.
    - The chosen i18n library should provide utilities for this, or we can use native browser APIs (`Intl` object).

#### 5. Right-to-Left (RTL) Language Support

- **Concept:** Some languages, like Arabic and Hebrew, are read from right to left. This requires the entire UI layout to be mirrored.
- **Considerations:** This is a significant effort. We need to ensure our CSS is structured in a way that supports RTL layouts, often by using logical properties (e.g., `margin-inline-start` instead of `margin-left`).

#### 6. Asset Localization

- **Concept:** Some images, videos, or downloadable documents may contain text. These assets will also need to be localized.
- **Action:** We need to identify all such assets and plan a system for serving the correct version based on the user's selected language.

#### 7. Language Selection Mechanism

- **Concept:** How will the application determine which language to display?
- **Options to consider:**
    1.  Detecting the user's browser language settings (`Accept-Language` header).
    2.  Providing an explicit language switcher in the app's UI.
    3.  Saving the user's preference in their profile.
    - A combination of these is usually the best approach.
