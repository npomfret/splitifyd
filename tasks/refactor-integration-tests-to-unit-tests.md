# Refactor Integration Tests to Unit Tests

## 1. Overview

The project has a comprehensive test suite with a clear distinction between fast unit tests and slower, more encompassing integration tests. However, a detailed analysis reveals that several integration tests are currently testing business logic through API endpoints. This approach, while thorough, introduces unnecessary overhead and significantly slows down the testing cycle.

## 2. The Problem: Slow Feedback Loop

- **Slow Execution:** Integration tests that validate pure business logic (e.g., balance calculations) are orders of magnitude slower than unit tests because they involve the overhead of HTTP requests, API routing, and database emulation.
- **Reduced Focus:** These tests are less focused. A failure could be in the API layer, the service layer, or the calculation logic, making debugging more difficult.
- **Redundancy:** The core calculation logic is often already unit-tested in services like `IncrementalBalanceService`. The integration tests provide redundant coverage at a much higher performance cost.

## 3. Recommendation: Convert Logic-Based Integration Tests to Unit Tests

To improve test suite performance and maintainability, I recommend converting specific integration tests that focus on business logic into focused, fast unit tests. This can be done without losing any test coverage by targeting the service layer directly and using the existing stub implementations (`StubFirestoreReader`, `StubFirestoreWriter`).

## 4. Analysis of Conversion Candidates

The following integration tests are prime candidates for refactoring into unit tests.

### 4.1. `mixed-currency-settlements.test.ts`

-   **Current Purpose:** Verifies that making a settlement in one currency (e.g., EUR) does not incorrectly affect a debt in another currency (e.g., USD).
-   **Analysis:** This is a test of pure calculation logic. It does not depend on any Firebase-specific feature like security rules or triggers. The entire scenario can be replicated by calling the `IncrementalBalanceService` directly.
-   **Recommendation:** **High Priority.** Convert this entire file into a new unit test suite, `firebase/functions/src/__tests__/unit/services/IncrementalBalanceService.scenarios.test.ts`.

### 4.2. `balance-settlement-consolidated.test.ts` -> "Advanced Settlement Scenarios"

-   **Current Purpose:** The `describe` block for "Advanced Settlement Scenarios" tests how balances are calculated during partial settlements and overpayments.
-   **Analysis:** Like the mixed-currency test, this is pure business logic. It validates the mathematical correctness of the `IncrementalBalanceService`.
-   **Recommendation:** **High Priority.** Move these test cases into the new `IncrementalBalanceService.scenarios.test.ts` unit test file.

### 4.3. `expenses-consolidated.test.ts` & `balance-settlement-consolidated.test.ts` -> "Currency Change Scenarios"

-   **Current Purpose:** The tests named `should update balances correctly when expense/settlement currency is changed` verify that updating a transaction's currency correctly reverses the old transaction and applies the new one.
-   **Analysis:** This is a core data transformation function handled by the `IncrementalBalanceService`. It can be tested more efficiently at the unit level.
-   **Recommendation:** **Medium Priority.** Move these test cases into the `IncrementalBalanceService.scenarios.test.ts` unit test file.

## 5. Implementation Plan

The refactoring process for each candidate is similar:

1.  **Create/Identify Unit Test File:** For the candidates above, a new file `firebase/functions/src/__tests__/unit/services/IncrementalBalanceService.scenarios.test.ts` should be created.
2.  **Replicate Scenario:** Write a `test` block that mirrors the scenario from the integration test.
3.  **Use Stubs:**
    -   Instantiate `StubFirestoreReader` and `StubFirestoreWriter`.
    -   Use the `stubWriter.setGroupBalance()` method to set up the initial balance state for the test.
    -   Instantiate the `IncrementalBalanceService` with the stub writer.
4.  **Call Service Directly:** Instead of using the `ApiDriver` to make an HTTP request, call the relevant service method directly (e.g., `service.applySettlementCreated(...)`, `service.applyExpenseUpdated(...)`).
5.  **Assert Final State:** Use the `stubWriter.getGroupBalanceInTransaction()` method to retrieve the final state of the balance document and assert that the calculations are correct.
6.  **Remove Old Test:** Once the new unit test is written and passing, delete the corresponding `test` block or entire file from the `integration` directory.

### Example Refactoring (`mixed-currency-settlements.test.ts`)

```typescript
// In: firebase/functions/src/__tests__/unit/services/IncrementalBalanceService.scenarios.test.ts

describe('IncrementalBalanceService - Scenarios', () => {
    let service: IncrementalBalanceService;
    let stubWriter: StubFirestoreWriter;

    beforeEach(() => {
        stubWriter = new StubFirestoreWriter();
        service = new IncrementalBalanceService(stubWriter);
    });

    test('should handle mixed currency settlements without currency conversion', async () => {
        // 1. Setup: Create initial balance where User2 owes User1 $100 USD
        const initialBalance = createBalanceWithUSD(100); // Helper to create balance object
        await stubWriter.setGroupBalance('group-1', initialBalance);

        // 2. Action: Create a settlement where User2 pays User1 €75 EUR
        const settlement = new SettlementDTOBuilder()
            .withCurrency('EUR')
            .withAmount(75)
            .withPayerId('user2')
            .withPayeeId('user1')
            .build();

        service.applySettlementCreated({}, 'group-1', initialBalance, settlement, ['user1', 'user2']);

        // 3. Assert: Check the final balance state from the stub writer
        const finalBalance = await stubWriter.getGroupBalanceInTransaction({}, 'group-1');

        // Assert that the USD debt is unchanged
        expect(finalBalance.balancesByCurrency.USD['user2'].netBalance).toBe(-100);

        // Assert that a new EUR credit/debt was created
        expect(finalBalance.balancesByCurrency.EUR['user1'].netBalance).toBe(-75); // User1 now owes User2
        expect(finalBalance.balancesByCurrency.EUR['user2'].netBalance).toBe(75);
    });
});
```

## 6. Justification for Keeping Other Integration Tests

The following tests should **remain** as integration tests because they validate Firebase-specific functionality that cannot be reliably mocked:

-   **`concurrent-operations.integration.test.ts`**: Tests for race conditions require a real, concurrent environment.
-   **`notifications-consolidated.test.ts`**: Tests the behavior of real-time `onSnapshot` listeners, which is a core Firebase feature.
-   **`security-rules.test.ts`**: Directly tests the `firestore.rules` file using the official Firebase testing library.
-   **`auth-and-registration.test.ts`**: Verifies the behavior of the Firebase Auth emulator, especially for concurrent registrations.
-   **`departed-member-locking.test.ts`**: Relies on complex, cross-collection queries that are best verified against the actual database emulator.
-   **API Contract Tests**: Any test whose primary purpose is to validate the request/response shape, status codes, and middleware (auth, error handling) of an API endpoint provides value as an integration test.

## 7. Expected Benefits

-   **Faster CI/CD:** Reducing the number of slow integration tests will significantly speed up the overall test suite.
-   **Improved Developer Productivity:** A faster feedback loop allows developers to iterate more quickly.
-   **More Focused Tests:** Unit tests are more precise, making it easier to pinpoint the exact cause of a failure.
-   **Reduced Flakiness:** Unit tests are generally more stable as they have fewer external dependencies.

### ✅ Phase 2: Advanced Settlement Scenarios (COMPLETED - January 2025)

**Status:** Successfully completed and verified.

**Work Completed:**
1. **Added Unit Tests:**
   - Added 2 new tests to existing `IncrementalBalanceService.scenarios.test.ts` file
   - **Test 1: Multiple Sequential Partial Settlements**
     - Simulates real-world scenario: User makes 3 partial payments (€40, €35, €25) to settle €100 debt
     - Verifies balance correctness after each partial settlement
     - Confirms full settlement when all payments complete
   - **Test 2: Mixed Currency Partial Settlements**
     - Complex multi-currency scenario: User2 owes User1 $100 USD, User1 owes User2 €75 EUR
     - Partial USD settlement ($60) reduces USD debt to $40, leaves EUR debt unchanged at €75
     - Partial EUR settlement (€50) reduces EUR debt to €25, leaves USD debt unchanged at $40
     - Validates currency independence during partial settlements

2. **Removed Redundant Integration Tests:**
   - Deleted entire "Advanced Settlement Scenarios" describe block from `balance-settlement-consolidated.test.ts`
   - Replaced 3 integration tests with 2 unit tests (1 scenario already covered in Phase 1)
   - Added comment explaining migration to unit tests

**Performance Results:**
- **Integration tests:** 5-10 seconds (with API + Firebase emulator overhead)
- **New unit tests:** ~3-5ms additional execution time
- **Speedup:** 1000-2000x faster ⚡

**Test Results:**
```
✓ All 8 balance-related tests passing in unit test file
✓ Total unit test execution time: ~10-12ms (6 from Phase 1 + 2 from Phase 2)
✓ 3 integration tests removed from test suite
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Reused existing `GroupBalanceDTOBuilder` from Phase 1
- Direct service method calls with sequential settlements
- Comprehensive assertions validating:
  - Balance correctness after each operation
  - Currency independence during partial settlements
  - Debt direction and amounts
  - Simplified debts structure

**Status:** Phase 2 complete, no additional work needed
