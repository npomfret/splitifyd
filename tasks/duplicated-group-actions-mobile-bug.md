# Bug Report: Duplicated Group Action Buttons in Mobile View

## Description

In the mobile view of the application, the group actions buttons are appearing in duplicate. They correctly display within a designated "group actions" container. However, a second set of these same buttons is visible, floating independently above the expenses view, leading to a cluttered and confusing user interface.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Access the application on a mobile device or a browser with a mobile viewport size.
2. Navigate to any group's detail page.
3. Observe the area above the expenses list.

## Expected Behavior

The group action buttons should only appear once, contained within the "group actions" container. The duplicated set of buttons floating above the expenses view should not be present.

## Actual Behavior

The group actions buttons are duplicated, appearing both within their intended container and as a floating set above the expenses view.
