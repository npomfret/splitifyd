# Task: Complete Balance Calculation Type Safety

## Overview

This document tracks the remaining work to achieve complete type safety in the Firestore data validation system. The major validation migration is complete (95%+), with only balance calculation type safety remaining.

## Remaining Work

### Balance Calculation Type Safety (Priority: Medium)

**Current Issue:**
Several `as any` casts remain in `GroupService.ts` for balance calculation results, representing the last significant type safety gap in the validation system.

**Required Actions:**
1. Create proper TypeScript interfaces or Zod schemas for balance calculation results
2. Remove remaining `as any` casts in GroupService balance operations
3. Ensure type safety throughout the balance calculation pipeline

**Implementation Options:**

#### Option 1: Zod Schema Approach
- Create `BalanceCalculationResultSchema` in `schemas/balance.ts`
- Define schemas for:
  - `CurrencyBalanceResult` - Individual currency balance results
  - `GroupBalanceCalculationResult` - Complete balance calculation output
- Add runtime validation to balance calculation results
- Export inferred types from schemas for compile-time safety

#### Option 2: TypeScript Interface Approach
- Define proper interfaces in `services/balance/types.ts`
- Create:
  - `CurrencyBalanceResult` interface
  - `GroupBalanceCalculationResult` interface
- Update `BalanceCalculationService` to use proper return types
- Update `GroupService.addComputedFields()` to use typed interfaces

**Benefits:**
- Complete elimination of remaining `as any` casts
- Full type safety across the entire validation system
- Better IDE support and type checking
- Prevents runtime errors from malformed balance data

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

## Success Criteria

- [ ] No `as any` casts remain in GroupService balance operations
- [ ] Balance calculation results are fully typed
- [ ] All tests pass with strict type checking
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors

## Notes

The Firestore data validation migration has been highly successful, with comprehensive Zod schema validation implemented across all core document types. This final enhancement will achieve 100% type safety at all Firestore boundaries.
