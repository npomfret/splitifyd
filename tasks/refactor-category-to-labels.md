# Refactor "Category" to "Labels"

This document outlines all the necessary changes to refactor the concept of "category" to "labels" throughout the codebase.

**Note on nomenclature:** The request was to refactor "category" (singular) to "labels" (plural). This is ambiguous. This document assumes the following mapping:
- "category" (singular) becomes "label" (singular)
- "categories" (plural) becomes "labels" (plural)
- `INVALID_CATEGORY` becomes `INVALID_LABEL`
- `ExpenseCategory` becomes `ExpenseLabel`

This will need to be confirmed before implementation.
