# Test Suite Audit Report

This report details findings from a comprehensive audit of the project's test suite. The goal was to identify tests that are misleading, incomplete, or otherwise problematic.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Misleading Test Names

Several tests have names that do not accurately reflect what the test is actually doing. This can make it difficult to understand the purpose of the test and can lead to confusion when debugging.

- **File:** `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/edge-cases/performance-monitoring.e2e.test.ts`
  - **Test:** `should maintain full functionality with slow network`
  - **Analysis:** The test name suggests it's a performance monitoring test, but the implementation is actually a comprehensive functionality test of the login and registration pages under simulated slow network conditions. It tests form input, validation, and navigation.
  - **Recommendation:** Rename the test to more accurately reflect its purpose, such as `should handle login and registration form interactions correctly on a slow network`.

- **File:** `firebase/functions/src/__tests__/integration/normal-flow/groups/group-crud.test.ts`
  - **Test:** `should be able to fetch balances immediately after creating group`
  - **Analysis:** This test claims to be about fetching balances, but the implementation only verifies that the group was created and can be fetched. It does not contain any assertions about the group's balance.
  - **Recommendation:** Either add assertions to verify the balance information or rename the test to `should be able to fetch group details immediately after creation`.

### 2. Incomplete or Trivial Tests

Some tests are incomplete, lack meaningful assertions, or only test trivial cases.

- **File:** `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/edge-cases/error-monitoring.e2e.test.ts`
  - **Tests:** `should load homepage without JavaScript errors`, `should load login page without JavaScript errors`, etc.
  - **Analysis:** These tests navigate to a page and then do nothing. The only validation comes from the global `setupConsoleErrorReporting` helper, which is not explicitly part of the test's implementation. This makes the tests brittle and their purpose unclear.
  - **Recommendation:** Add explicit assertions to each test to verify that key elements of the page are visible and interactive. For example, after navigating to the login page, assert that the email and password fields are visible.

- **File:** `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/edge-cases/accessibility-navigation.e2e.test.ts`
  - **Test:** `should navigate login form with keyboard`
  - **Analysis:** This test simulates keyboard navigation but contains no assertions to verify that the focus is in the correct place or that the form submission was successful. It only verifies that no console errors occurred.
  - **Recommendation:** Add assertions after each `Tab` press to verify that the correct element has focus. For example, `await expect(loginPage.getEmailInput()).toBeFocused();`.

- **File:** `firebase/functions/src/__tests__/integration/normal-flow/settlement-realtime.test.ts`
  - **Test:** `documents the frontend bug: refreshAll() does not fetch settlements`
  - **Analysis:** This is not a real test; it's a documentation of a bug in the form of a test that only asserts `expect(true).toBe(true)`. This clutters the test suite and can be misleading.
  - **Recommendation:** Move this information to a proper bug report or task in the issue tracker and remove the "test".

### 3. Redundant Tests

There are several instances of redundant tests that could be consolidated.

- **File:** `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/error-testing/api-errors.e2e.test.ts` and `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/error-testing/network-errors.e2e.test.ts`
  - **Analysis:** Both files test similar scenarios of API error handling (malformed responses, server errors, network failures). These could be consolidated into a single, more comprehensive error handling test suite.
  - **Recommendation:** Merge the tests from `api-errors.e2e.test.ts` into `network-errors.e2e.test.ts` and delete the former.

- **File:** `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/error-testing/share-link-error-scenarios.e2e.test.ts` and `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/integration/error-testing/share-link-errors.e2e.test.ts`
  - **Analysis:** These two files both test error handling for share links. Their contents are very similar and could be merged.
  - **Recommendation:** Consolidate the tests into a single file, for example `share-link-errors.e2e.test.ts`, and remove the other.

### 4. Skipped Tests

- **File:** `e2e-tests/src/__tests__/unit/hardcoded-values.test.ts`
  - **Test:** `should not contain "splitifyd" in any git tracked files`
  - **Analysis:** This test is skipped with `it.skip`. Skipped tests should be reviewed to determine if they are still relevant. If so, they should be fixed and re-enabled. If not, they should be removed.
  - **Recommendation:** Review the purpose of this test. If it's still needed, update the exceptions list and re-enable it. Otherwise, delete it.

### 5. Commented-Out Tests

- **File:** `firebase/functions/src/__tests__/integration/normal-flow/group-permissions.test.ts`
  - **Analysis:** The entire `Pending Members` describe block is commented out, with a note that the feature is not yet implemented.
  - **Recommendation:** This is acceptable, as it indicates work in progress. However, it's important to ensure these tests are uncommented and completed when the feature is implemented.

## General Recommendations

- **Improve Test Descriptions:** Ensure that test names are descriptive and accurately reflect the behavior being tested.
- **Add Explicit Assertions:** Avoid "smoke tests" that only check for the absence of errors. Every test should have explicit assertions that verify the expected outcome.
- **Consolidate Redundant Tests:** Regularly review the test suite for opportunities to merge similar tests, which will improve maintainability and reduce execution time.
- **Manage Skipped Tests:** Maintain a policy for skipped tests. They should either be addressed in a timely manner or removed.
