# BUG: Expenses Disappear When New Users Join Group

## Priority: CRITICAL 🔴

## Summary
Expenses are being deleted or not properly synchronized when new users join a group, causing groups to incorrectly show as "All settled up!" and redirecting users to the dashboard instead of the group page.

## Environment
- **Test**: `three-user-settlement.e2e.test.ts`
- **Location**: Normal flow E2E tests
- **Frequency**: Intermittent (causes test flakiness)
- **First Detected**: August 14, 2025

## Steps to Reproduce
1. User 1 creates a new group
2. User 1 adds an expense (e.g., $120 "Group dinner expense")
3. User 2 joins the group via invite link
4. User 3 joins the group via invite link
5. **BUG**: The expense disappears from the group
6. Group shows "All settled up!" and "No expenses yet. Add one to get started!"
7. User 2 gets redirected to dashboard when trying to access the group

## Expected Behavior
- Expenses should persist when new users join a group
- All users should see the same expenses
- Users should remain on the group page when there are unsettled expenses
- Balances should be recalculated to include new members

## Actual Behavior
- Expenses disappear when new users join
- Group incorrectly shows as "All settled up!"
- Users get redirected to dashboard
- No expense data is visible to any user

## Evidence
### Screenshots from Failed Test Run

1. **Initial State** (User 1 after creating expense):
   - Shows 3 members: u 107e6822, u q7567gg5, u fffe405p
   - Shows $120 "Group dinner expense"
   - Shows correct balances ($40 each owed)
   - Payment history visible

2. **After Users Join** (Bug occurs):
   - Group shows "All settled up!"
   - "No expenses yet. Add one to get started!"
   - 3 members still listed
   - Balances show as "All settled up!"
   - No payment history

3. **User 2's Dashboard View**:
   - Group shows as "Settled up" with "just now" timestamp
   - 3 members count is correct
   - User gets redirected here instead of group page

## Console Logs
- No JavaScript errors reported
- API calls appear successful (200 responses)
- Navigation logs show redirect from group to dashboard

## Impact
- **Data Loss**: User-entered expenses are lost
- **User Experience**: Users cannot track shared expenses
- **Test Stability**: Causes E2E tests to fail intermittently
- **Trust**: Users may lose confidence if their data disappears

## Root Cause Analysis (CONFIRMED)

### Primary Issue: Concurrent Updates Without Optimistic Locking
After thorough investigation including creating integration tests and reproducing the E2E failure:

1. **The Problem**:
   - Multiple users joining simultaneously create a race condition
   - While backend transactions are atomic, they don't check if the document was modified between read and write
   - Example: User A and User B both read group at the same time, then both try to update memberIds
   - Without optimistic locking, both updates succeed but may be based on stale data

2. **Investigation Results**:
   - Created `group-member-race-conditions.test.ts` - integration tests PASS (backend handles updates correctly)
   - E2E test `three-user-settlement.e2e.test.ts` FAILS - users get redirected to dashboard
   - This suggests a timing/state synchronization issue between concurrent operations

3. **Missing Safeguards**:
   - No optimistic concurrency control using timestamps or version numbers
   - Transactions don't verify the document hasn't changed since it was read
   - No conflict detection for simultaneous updates

## Related Code Areas to Investigate
- `firebase/functions/src/groups/shareHandlers.ts` (lines 227-271) - Join group transaction
- `firebase/functions/src/groups/handlers.ts` - Update group handlers
- Webapp's group state management and update logic
- Any place doing `setDoc` instead of `updateDoc` or field-specific updates
- Client-side caching/state that might have stale data

## Test Details
- **Test File**: `e2e-tests/src/tests/normal-flow/three-user-settlement.e2e.test.ts`
- **Failure Point**: Line 90 - `synchronizeMultiUserState` 
- **Error Message**: "Navigation failed for User 2. Expected URL to contain /groups/[id], but got: http://localhost:9005/dashboard"

## Chosen Solution: Timestamp-Based Optimistic Locking

### Implementation Plan
We will implement **optimistic locking using the existing `updatedAt` timestamp field** to prevent concurrent update conflicts. This is a production-grade solution that fixes the root cause at the database level.

**IMPORTANT**: This pattern must be applied to ALL updatable documents across all collections, not just groups.

### How It Works
1. **Read Phase**: Store the current `updatedAt` timestamp when reading a document
2. **Validation Phase**: Before updating, verify the `updatedAt` hasn't changed
3. **Write Phase**: Only update if timestamp matches, otherwise reject with `CONCURRENT_UPDATE` error
4. **Client Retry**: Client receives 409 Conflict and retries with fresh data

### Why This Solution
- **No schema changes needed** - Uses existing `updatedAt` field
- **Database-level guarantee** - Prevents dirty writes regardless of client implementation
- **Standard pattern** - Well-understood optimistic locking mechanism
- **Handles true concurrency** - Works when operations happen at exactly the same time
- **Comprehensive protection** - Applied to all collections prevents race conditions everywhere

### Server-Side Changes Required

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **Create Optimistic Locking Utilities** (`utils/optimistic-locking.ts`):
   - `checkTimestampConflict(transaction, docRef, originalTimestamp)`
   - `updateWithTimestamp(transaction, docRef, updates)`
   - Reusable across all collections

2. **Add CONCURRENT_UPDATE Error** (`utils/errors.ts`):
   - HTTP 409 Conflict status
   - Clear retry message
   - Used by all collections

#### Phase 2: Apply to All Collections

**Groups Collection** (`groups/handlers.ts`, `groups/shareHandlers.ts`):
- `joinGroupByLink` - validate timestamp before adding members
- `updateGroup` - validate timestamp before updating
- `generateShareableLink` - validate timestamp before adding link

**Expenses Collection** (`expenses/handlers.ts`):
- `updateExpense` - validate timestamp before modifying
- `deleteExpense` - validate timestamp before deletion

**Settlements Collection** (`settlements/handlers.ts`):
- `updateSettlement` - validate timestamp before modifying
- `deleteSettlement` - validate timestamp before deletion

**Users Collection** (`auth/handlers.ts`, `policies/user-handlers.ts`):
- Policy acceptance updates
- Profile updates
- Theme color assignments

**Policies Collection** (`policies/handlers.ts`):
- `updatePolicy` - validate timestamp before updating

#### Example Implementation Pattern:
```typescript
// In any transaction that updates a document
const docRef = collection.doc(id);
const doc = await transaction.get(docRef);
const originalUpdatedAt = doc.data().updatedAt;

// ... prepare updates ...

// Verify timestamp hasn't changed
const freshDoc = await transaction.get(docRef);
if (!freshDoc.data().updatedAt.isEqual(originalUpdatedAt)) {
  throw new ApiError(HTTP_STATUS.CONFLICT, 'CONCURRENT_UPDATE', 
    'Document was modified by another user. Please retry.');
}

// Apply update with new timestamp
transaction.update(docRef, {
  ...updates,
  updatedAt: Timestamp.now()
});
```

### Client-Side Changes Required

**IMPORTANT**: The webapp must handle the new `CONCURRENT_UPDATE` (409 Conflict) response gracefully across ALL stores:

#### Phase 1: Generic Retry Handler
Create a reusable retry utility (`utils/retry-handler.ts`):
```typescript
async function retryOnConflict<T>(
  operation: () => Promise<T>, 
  maxRetries = 3
): Promise<T> {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.code === 'CONCURRENT_UPDATE' && attempt < maxRetries - 1) {
        // Exponential backoff: 100ms, 200ms, 400ms
        await new Promise(resolve => 
          setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, attempt) * 100)
        );
        continue;
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Phase 2: Apply to All Stores
- **groups-store.ts**: Handle conflicts on group updates
- **expense-form-store.ts**: Handle conflicts on expense save/update
- **settlement-store.ts**: Handle conflicts on settlement operations
- **auth-store.ts**: Handle conflicts on profile/policy updates
- **join-group-store.ts**: Handle conflicts when joining groups

#### Example Store Implementation:
```typescript
// In any store that updates documents
async updateDocument(id: string, updates: any) {
  return retryOnConflict(async () => {
    // Fetch fresh data
    const doc = await fetchDocument(id);
    
    // Apply updates to fresh data
    const updatedData = { ...doc, ...updates };
    
    // Save with potential conflict
    return await saveDocument(id, updatedData);
  });
}
```

#### User Feedback:
- Show loading spinner during retries
- If all retries fail: "Another user is updating this. Please try again."
- Log retry attempts for debugging

### Benefits
- **True fix**: Solves the race condition at its root
- **No data loss**: Prevents any possibility of losing expenses
- **Scalable**: Works for any number of concurrent users
- **Transparent**: Clear conflict detection and resolution

## Workaround
None identified. This is a data loss issue that requires a fix.

## Fix Verification
Once fixed, the `three-user-settlement.e2e.test.ts` test should:
1. Pass consistently without flakiness
2. Show expenses persist when users join
3. Keep all users on the group page
4. Display correct balances for all members

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Tests Created
1. **group-member-race-conditions.test.ts** (CREATED & PASSING):
   - Tests expenses persist when users join
   - Tests concurrent user joins and expense creation
   - Tests rapid successive joins
   - Verifies data integrity after operations
   - **Status**: All tests pass, confirming backend handles atomic updates correctly

### Integration Tests Needed After Fix

2. **Generic Optimistic Locking Tests** (`optimistic-locking.test.ts`):
   - Test pattern that works for all collections
   - Verify CONCURRENT_UPDATE errors are thrown
   - Test retry logic with fresh data succeeds
   - Ensure only one concurrent update succeeds

3. **Collection-Specific Tests**:
   - **group-optimistic-locking.test.ts**: Test group update conflicts
   - **expense-optimistic-locking.test.ts**: Test expense update conflicts
   - **settlement-optimistic-locking.test.ts**: Test settlement conflicts
   - **user-optimistic-locking.test.ts**: Test user profile conflicts
   - **policy-optimistic-locking.test.ts**: Test policy update conflicts

### Test Pattern for Each Collection:
```typescript
describe('Optimistic Locking - [Collection]', () => {
  test('detects concurrent updates', async () => {
    // Create document
    const doc = await createDocument();
    
    // Simulate two concurrent updates
    const update1 = updateDocument(doc.id, { field1: 'value1' });
    const update2 = updateDocument(doc.id, { field2: 'value2' });
    
    // Run concurrently
    const results = await Promise.allSettled([update1, update2]);
    
    // One should succeed, one should get CONCURRENT_UPDATE
    const successes = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled');
    const conflicts = results.filter(r => 
      r.status === 'rejected' && 
      r.reason.code === 'CONCURRENT_UPDATE'
    );
    
    expect(successes).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(conflicts).toHaveLength(1);
  });
  
  test('retry succeeds with fresh data', async () => {
    // Test that retrying with fresh data works
  });
});
```

### E2E Test Validation
- **three-user-settlement.e2e.test.ts** (CURRENTLY FAILING):
   - Should pass consistently after implementing optimistic locking
   - Validates the complete user flow works correctly
   - Ensures no users are redirected to dashboard incorrectly

## Implementation Status
- **Investigation**: ✅ Complete
- **Root Cause**: ✅ Identified (missing optimistic locking)
- **Solution Design**: ✅ Complete (timestamp-based optimistic locking for ALL collections)
- **Scope Expanded**: ✅ Apply to all updatable documents, not just groups
- **Server Implementation**: ⏳ Pending (5 collections to update)
- **Client Implementation**: ⏳ Pending (generic retry handler + all stores)
- **Testing**: ⏳ Pending (generic + collection-specific tests needed)

## Implementation Priority
1. **Groups Collection** (Fixes immediate bug)
2. **Expenses & Settlements** (Core user-facing features)
3. **Users Collection** (Profile/policy updates)
4. **Policies Collection** (Admin operations)

## Key Insights
- The bug revealed a systemic issue: **NO collection has optimistic locking protection**
- This could cause race conditions anywhere in the app, not just groups
- The solution must be comprehensive to prevent similar bugs elsewhere
- Using existing `updatedAt` field avoids schema migrations
- Generic utilities ensure consistent implementation across all collections

## Additional Notes
- Bug was discovered while debugging flaky E2E tests
- User pool was also fixed to use consistent IDs for email and display name for better debugging
- The solution uses existing `updatedAt` field instead of adding a new version field
- Client must handle 409 Conflict responses with retry logic
- This is a standard optimistic locking pattern used in production systems
- Implementation must be consistent across ALL collections to prevent future race conditions
