# E2E Test Failures Analysis

## Executive Summary

**As of 2025-08-03, 8 tests are failing** after implementing partial fixes. One test has been fixed (`should show member in expense split options`).

## Currently Failing Tests (8 total)

### 1. complex-unsettled-group.e2e.test.ts (1 test)
- `create group with multiple people and expenses that is NOT settled`

### 2. delete-operations.e2e.test.ts (1 test)
- `should handle multi-user expense visibility`

### 3. duplicate-registration.e2e.test.ts (2 tests)
- `should show error immediately without clearing form`
- `should allow registration with different email after duplicate attempt`

### 4. member-management.e2e.test.ts (1 test)
- `should show share functionality`

### 5. multi-user-collaboration.e2e.test.ts (2 tests)
- `should handle group sharing via share link`
- `should allow multiple users to add expenses to same group`

### 6. multi-user-expenses.e2e.test.ts (1 test)
- `multiple users can join a group via share link and add expenses`

## Failure Categories

### Category 1: Modal Dialog Issues (1 test)
**Tests:**
- member-management: `should show share functionality`

**Pattern:** Tests failing to find or interact with modal dialogs
**Status:** Partially fixed - ARIA attributes added, one test now passing

### Category 2: Multi-User Flow Issues (5 tests)
**Tests:**
- complex-unsettled-group: `create group with multiple people and expenses that is NOT settled`
- delete-operations: `should handle multi-user expense visibility`
- multi-user-collaboration: `should handle group sharing via share link`
- multi-user-collaboration: `should allow multiple users to add expenses to same group`
- multi-user-expenses: `multiple users can join a group via share link and add expenses`

**Pattern:** All tests involving multiple users or group sharing fail

### Category 3: Form/Navigation Issues (2 tests)
**Tests:**
- duplicate-registration: `should show error immediately without clearing form`
- duplicate-registration: `should allow registration with different email after duplicate attempt`

**Pattern:** Registration form behavior and navigation after errors

## Progress Update

### Completed Fixes:
1. ✅ Added ARIA attributes to modals (ShareGroupModal and CreateGroupModal)
2. ✅ Updated modal selectors to use proper role-based queries
3. ✅ Fixed multi-user join flow navigation (changed from parsing URL to direct navigation)
4. ✅ Updated MultiUserTestBuilder to properly click "Join Group" button
5. ✅ Removed hardcoded URLs from tests

### Remaining Issues:
1. **Share modal test still failing** - May need additional fixes for the share functionality test
2. **Multi-user flows** - Despite navigation fixes, still experiencing failures
3. **Form state management** - Registration form tests still failing
4. **Complex group scenarios** - Balance calculation or display issues

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Modal Dialog Issues (2 tests)
**Target Tests:**
- `member-management.e2e.test.ts`: "should show share functionality"
- `member-management.e2e.test.ts`: "should show member in expense split options"

**Steps:**
1. Update modal selectors to use more specific targeting:
   - ShareGroupModal uses `.fixed.inset-0` as the backdrop
   - Test expects `role="dialog"` but component doesn't have this attribute
   - Add `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` to the modal container
   - Update test to use more specific selectors

2. Fix the share modal interaction:
   - Ensure modal opens correctly
   - Verify the share link input is accessible
   - Check that keyboard navigation (Escape) works

### Phase 2: Fix Multi-User Flow Issues (5 tests)
**Target Tests:**
- All tests in `multi-user-collaboration.e2e.test.ts`
- `multi-user-expenses.e2e.test.ts`
- `complex-unsettled-group.e2e.test.ts`
- `delete-operations.e2e.test.ts`: "should handle multi-user expense visibility"

**Steps:**
1. Debug join flow navigation:
   - Check if `/join` route exists and is properly configured
   - Verify the join group store is handling the flow correctly
   - Ensure proper redirect after joining

2. Fix session handling between browser contexts:
   - Verify auth tokens are properly isolated between contexts
   - Check that new browser contexts can authenticate independently

3. Update share link generation and parsing:
   - Verify API returns correct share URL format
   - Ensure join page handles the link ID correctly

### Phase 3: Fix Form/Navigation Issues (2 tests)
**Target Tests:**
- `duplicate-registration.e2e.test.ts`: both tests

**Steps:**
1. Fix error display persistence:
   - Ensure form doesn't clear when API returns error
   - Verify error messages are displayed correctly

2. Fix logout navigation timing:
   - Add proper wait conditions after logout
   - Ensure clean navigation to register page

### Phase 4: Integration and Verification
1. Run all tests in single-threaded mode to verify fixes
2. Run tests in parallel to ensure no race conditions
3. Update any flaky test patterns found during fixes

## Commit Strategy
Each phase will be committed separately:
1. "fix(e2e): Add ARIA attributes to modals and update selectors"
2. "fix(e2e): Fix multi-user flows and join group navigation"
3. "fix(e2e): Fix registration form state and navigation timing"
4. "test(e2e): Stabilize and verify all e2e tests"
