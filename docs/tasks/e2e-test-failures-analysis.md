### Previously Fixed Tests Now Passing ‚úÖ

Based on the test results, the following tests that were documented as failing are now passing:
- `delete-operations.e2e.test.ts`: "should create and view an expense" ‚úÖ
- `balance-settlement.e2e.test.ts`: "should calculate balances after expenses" ‚úÖ
- `balance-settlement.e2e.test.ts`: "should handle complex balance calculations" ‚úÖ
- `duplicate-registration.e2e.test.ts`: Main duplicate registration test ‚úÖ

## Progress Update (2025-08-03)

### Completed Fixes

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority 1: Create Group Modal Input Issue (REGRESSED)
**Previous Solution**: Added proper wait conditions and error handling in `create-group-modal.page.ts`
- Added explicit wait for modal to be visible
- Added fallback selectors for better reliability
- Improved error messages with debugging info
- Tests passed when run individually or with limited parallelism

**Key Changes Applied**:
```typescript
// Wait for modal to be fully visible first
await this.page.getByText(this.modalTitle).waitFor({ state: 'visible' });

// Wait for input to be enabled
await expect(nameInput).toBeEnabled({ timeout: 5000 });

// Use force option for filling
await nameInput.fill(name, { force: true });
```

**Status**: This fix has REGRESSED - tests are failing again with the same create group modal issues

#### ‚úÖ Priority 2: Expense Detail Selector Violations (FIXED)
**Solution Applied**: Updated selector in `delete-operations.e2e.test.ts` to use `.first()`
```typescript
// Fixed from:
await expect(page.getByText('$50.00')).toBeVisible();

// To:
await expect(page.getByText('$50.00').first()).toBeVisible();
```

### New Tests Created

#### ‚úÖ Duplicate User Registration Tests
Created comprehensive tests to ensure the server properly handles duplicate user registrations:

1. **Integration Test** (`firebase/functions/__tests__/integration/duplicate-user-registration.test.ts`)
   - Tests server API directly
   - Verifies 409 Conflict response for duplicate emails
   - Tests concurrent registration attempts
   - Confirms email case-insensitivity
   - All tests pass ‚úÖ

2. **E2E Test** (`e2e-tests/tests/duplicate-registration.e2e.test.ts`)
   - Tests full user flow through UI
   - Successfully registers user, logs out, attempts duplicate registration
   - Verifies error message appears on screen: "An account with this email already exists"
   - Confirms 409 error in console (marked as expected with `skip-error-checking` annotation)
   - Test passes ‚úÖ

### Outstanding Issues

#### üîÑ Priority 3: Share Link Join Flow
**Status**: Not yet addressed
**Next Steps**:
- Need to investigate join flow implementation
- Check if URL format has changed
- Verify authentication during join process

#### üîÑ Priority 4: Modal Dialog Selectors
**Status**: Not yet addressed
**Next Steps**:
- Update share modal selectors
- Consider adding data-testid attributes

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. delete-operations.e2e.test.ts

#### Test: "should create and view an expense" ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Error**: `strict mode violation: getByText('$50.00') resolved to 2 elements`
- **Location**: Line 42
- **Root Cause**: The expense detail page has two elements with "$50.00" text:
  - `<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">$50.00</h2>` (heading)
  - `<p class="font-semibold">$50.00</p>` (paragraph)
- **Component**: ExpenseDetailPage.tsx
- **Fix Applied**: Used `.first()` selector

#### Test: "should handle multi-user expense visibility"
- **Error**: `page.waitForURL: Test timeout exceeded`
- **Location**: Line 76
- **Root Cause**: User 2 cannot join the group via share link - the navigation never completes
- **Component**: Join flow / routing
- **Status**: Pending fix

### 2. member-management.e2e.test.ts

#### Test: "should display current group members" ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Error**: `Failed to fill group name. Expected: "Members Display Group", Got: ""`
- **Location**: CreateGroupModalPage line 47
- **Root Cause**: The group name input field is not accepting input
- **Component**: CreateGroupModalPage form handling
- **Fix Applied**: Updated CreateGroupModalPage with better wait conditions

#### Test: "should show member in expense split options" ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Error**: Same create group modal issue
- **Root Cause**: Cannot proceed past group creation
- **Fix Applied**: Same as above

#### Test: "should show share functionality"
- **Error**: `[2mexpect([22m[31mlocator[39m[2m).[22mtoBeVisible[2m()[22m`
- **Location**: Line 112
- **Root Cause**: The share modal dialog selector doesn't match the actual DOM
- **Component**: Share modal implementation
- **Status**: Pending fix

### 3. add-expense.e2e.test.ts

#### All 4 tests in this file ‚úÖ FIXED:
- **Error**: `Failed to fill group name. Expected: "[Group Name]", Got: ""`
- **Tests affected**:
  - "should add new expense with equal split"
  - "should handle expense form validation"
  - "should allow selecting expense category"
  - "should show expense in group after creation"
- **Root Cause**: CreateGroupModalPage cannot fill the group name input

### 5. complex-unsettled-group.e2e.test.ts

#### Test: "create group with multiple people and expenses that is NOT settled" ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Error**: `MultiUserTestBuilder.createGroupWithFirstUser failed`
- **Root Cause**: The test builder relies on the same broken create group flow
- **Fix Applied**: Same as above

### 6. multi-user-collaboration.e2e.test.ts

#### Test: "should handle group sharing via share link"
- **Error**: `page.waitForURL: Test timeout`
- **Root Cause**: Join flow not completing navigation

- **Error**: `Failed to fill group name`
- **Root Cause**: Create group modal issue
- **Fix Applied**: Same as above

## Common Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Create Group Modal Input Failure (Critical) ‚úÖ FIXED
**Affected Tests**: 10 out of 12 failures
**Symptom**: Input field exists but doesn't accept text
**Root Cause**: Timing issues with modal animation and input readiness
**Solution Applied**: Added explicit waits and force fill option

### Pattern 2: Strict Mode Selector Violations ‚úÖ FIXED
**Affected Tests**: 1 test
**Symptom**: Multiple elements match the same text selector
**Solution Applied**: Use `.first()` selector

### Pattern 3: Share Link Navigation ‚úÖ FIXED
**Affected Tests**: 2 tests
**Symptom**: Navigation to group page after join never completes
**Root Cause**: 
- The join-group-store was trying to join the group during the preview phase
- Tests expected automatic navigation, but users need to click "Join Group" button
**Solution Applied**:
1. Created a new `/groups/preview` endpoint that returns group info without joining
2. Updated join-group-store to use preview endpoint instead of join endpoint
3. Updated tests to click the "Join Group" button before expecting navigation
4. Tests now pass when run individually

### Pattern 4: Modal Dialog Detection üîÑ PENDING
**Affected Tests**: 1 test
**Symptom**: Cannot find share modal dialog
**Possible Causes**:
- Selector mismatch
- Modal rendering outside expected container

## Lessons Learned

1. **Parallel Test Execution**: Tests that pass individually may fail when run in parallel due to timing issues
2. **Wait Strategies**: Explicit waits for element states are crucial for reliable tests
3. **Error Annotations**: Use `skip-error-checking` annotation for expected errors (e.g., 409 conflicts)
4. **Logout Flow**: Proper logout requires clicking user menu first, then the sign out button in dropdown

## Root Cause Fixed

The primary issue was that Playwright's `fill()` method wasn't properly triggering Preact signal updates. The solution was to:
1. Fix selector from `getByLabel('Group Name*')` to `getByLabel('Group Name')` 
2. Type each character individually to ensure onChange events fire
3. Add proper waits for button enablement

## Remaining Issues (14 tests)

1. ‚úÖ **Create Group Modal** - Fixed by typing characters individually
2. üîÑ **Share functionality modal** - Modal dialog selectors still need fixing
3. üîÑ **Multi-user join flow** - Missing "Join Group" button clicks
4. üîÑ **Homepage/static pages** - Timeout issues with networkidle
5. üîÑ **Duplicate registration** - Form validation timing issues
6. üîÑ **Performance tests** - Page load exceeding 5s threshold

### Recommended Approach
Given the widespread regression, consider:
1. Rolling back recent changes to find a stable baseline
2. Implementing more robust, permanent fixes rather than timing-based workarounds
3. Adding integration tests that run against the actual UI components
4. Creating a test stability tracking system to catch regressions early

## Regression Pattern Analysis

### Key Observations
1. **Widespread Regression**: 10 out of 16 failing tests were previously marked as fixed
2. **Create Group Modal**: The most critical fix has completely regressed
3. **Parallel Execution Issues**: Tests that passed individually are now failing even in isolation
4. **New Test Failures**: Additional tests are now failing that weren't documented before

### Possible Causes of Regression
1. **Recent Code Changes**: The commit history shows multiple "fixing tests" commits which may have introduced new issues
2. **Timing/Race Conditions**: The fixes may have been fragile and dependent on specific timing
3. **Environmental Changes**: Changes to the Firebase emulator or test environment
4. **Incomplete Fixes**: The original fixes may have addressed symptoms rather than root causes

## Notes

- The application appears to be using Preact (not React) which might affect timing
- The tests use Playwright's strict mode which is good for reliability
- Consider adding more specific selectors (data-testid) to avoid text-based selections
- The multi-user test scenarios are complex and may need special handling for timing
- Server correctly handles duplicate user registrations with 409 status
- Existing logout test confirmed in `dashboard.e2e.test.ts`
- Join flow now requires explicit user action (clicking Join button) for security
- Firebase functions auto-reload on changes but may need a few seconds to pick up new endpoints
- Create Group Modal issue appears intermittently when tests run in parallel
- **Major regression observed**: Previously fixed tests are failing again, indicating unstable fixes
