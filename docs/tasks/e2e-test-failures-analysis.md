# E2E Test Failures Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the systematic failures in the E2E test suite for the Splitifyd application. **As of 2025-08-03 (Updated), 8 tests are failing** after implementing timeout increase and fixing participant selection issues.

### Key Findings:
1. **Root Cause Identified**: Tests were failing due to:
   - Insufficient timeout (5s was too short for some operations)
   - Missing participant selection in expense creation
   - Modal dialog selector mismatches
   - Multi-user flow navigation issues
2. **Solutions Implemented**: 
   - Increased timeout from 5s to 10s in playwright.config.ts
   - Fixed participant selection logic (payer is auto-selected)
   - Fixed advanced-splitting tests by ensuring proper form validation
3. **Major Progress**: Down from 15 failing tests to 8 failing tests
4. **Remaining Issues**: Modal dialogs, multi-user flows, and navigation problems

## Current Test Status (2025-08-03 - UPDATED)

### Currently Failing Tests (8 total)

1. **complex-unsettled-group.e2e.test.ts** (1 test)
   - `create group with multiple people and expenses that is NOT settled`

2. **delete-operations.e2e.test.ts** (1 test)
   - `should handle multi-user expense visibility`

3. **duplicate-registration.e2e.test.ts** (1 test)
   - `should allow registration with different email after duplicate attempt`

4. **member-management.e2e.test.ts** (2 tests)
   - `should show member in expense split options`
   - `should show share functionality`

5. **multi-user-collaboration.e2e.test.ts** (2 tests)
   - `should handle group sharing via share link`
   - `should allow multiple users to add expenses to same group`

6. **multi-user-expenses.e2e.test.ts** (1 test)
   - `multiple users can join a group via share link and add expenses`

### Tests Fixed in This Session ✅

1. **add-expense.e2e.test.ts** - **ALL 4 TESTS NOW PASSING ✅**
   - Fixed by ensuring proper participant selection
   - Timeout increase helped with form submission timing

2. **advanced-splitting.e2e.test.ts** - **ALL 6 TESTS NOW PASSING ✅**
   - Fixed by understanding that payer is auto-selected as participant
   - Proper validation handling for different split types

3. **dashboard.e2e.test.ts** - **NOW PASSING ✅**
   - Fixed with timeout increase

4. **monitoring.e2e.test.ts** - **NOW PASSING ✅**
   - Fixed with timeout increase

5. **duplicate-registration.e2e.test.ts** - **1 of 2 tests NOW PASSING ✅**
   - "should show error immediately without clearing form" now passes

6. **balance-settlement.e2e.test.ts** - **STILL PASSING ✅**

## Root Cause Analysis & Solution

### The Problems Fixed

1. **Timeout Issues**: 5 seconds was insufficient for some operations, especially when running tests in parallel
   - **Solution**: Increased global timeout to 10 seconds in playwright.config.ts

2. **Participant Selection**: Tests were failing because no participants were selected for expense splits
   - **Root Cause**: When a user is selected as payer, they are automatically added as a participant
   - **Solution**: Tests now understand this behavior and don't need to manually select the payer

3. **Form Validation**: Expense form has strict validation that requires all fields to be properly filled
   - **Solution**: Tests now properly fill all required fields before submitting

### Implementation Details

#### Timeout Configuration Change
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  /* Global test timeout - 10 seconds to handle slower operations */
  timeout: 10000,
  // ... rest of config
});
```

#### Advanced Splitting Test Fix
```typescript
// Key insight: payer is auto-selected as participant
// The test now verifies the split section is visible but doesn't 
// need to manually select participants for single-user tests
const splitSection = page.locator('text=Split between').locator('..');
await expect(splitSection).toBeVisible();
```

## Remaining Issues Analysis

### Category 1: Modal Dialog Issues (2 tests)
- **member-management**: Share functionality test can't find dialog role
- **Root Cause**: The share modal might not have proper ARIA attributes
- **Next Step**: Update selectors to match actual modal implementation

### Category 2: Multi-User Flow Issues (5 tests)
- **Pattern**: All tests involving multiple users sharing groups fail
- **Root Cause**: Join flow navigation and user session management
- **Complexity**: These tests create multiple browser contexts for different users

### Category 3: Form Navigation Issue (1 test)
- **duplicate-registration**: Second test fails on navigation after logout
- **Root Cause**: Likely a timing issue with logout/navigation sequence

## Key Learnings

1. **Timeout Matters**: Many "flaky" tests were simply timing out due to insufficient wait time

2. **Understand the Application Logic**: The payer being auto-selected as participant is a feature, not a bug. Tests must align with application behavior.

3. **Validation is Strict**: The expense form validates all fields and prevents submission if validation fails. Tests must properly fill all required fields.

4. **Progress Tracking**: Systematic fixing reduced failures from 15 to 8 tests (47% improvement)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Modal Selectors** (2 tests)
   - Update share modal selectors in member-management tests
   - Consider using more specific locators instead of ARIA roles

2. **Debug Multi-User Flows** (5 tests)
   - Investigate join flow navigation
   - Check user session handling between contexts
   - May need to add explicit waits for navigation

3. **Fix Navigation Timing** (1 test)
   - Add proper wait after logout before navigation
   - Ensure clean state between test steps

## Test Stability Improvements

1. **Timeout Increase**: Global timeout now 10s (was 5s)
2. **Better Understanding**: Tests now align with application behavior
3. **Reduced Parallelism Impact**: Longer timeouts help with parallel execution

## Summary

Significant progress has been made:
- Reduced failing tests from 15 to 8 (47% improvement)
- Fixed all add-expense and advanced-splitting tests
- Identified clear patterns in remaining failures
- All remaining failures fall into three distinct categories

The remaining 8 failing tests are primarily related to:
1. Modal dialog selectors (2 tests)
2. Multi-user flows (5 tests)  
3. Navigation timing (1 test)

These can be systematically addressed with the approaches outlined above.
