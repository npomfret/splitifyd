# E2E Test Failures Analysis

## Executive Summary

**As of 2025-08-04, 4 tests are failing** after implementing fixes. Six tests have been fixed:
- `should show member in expense split options` 
- `should show error immediately without clearing form`
- `should prevent duplicate email registration and show error`
- `should allow registration with different email after duplicate attempt`
- `should show share functionality`
- `multiple users can join a group via share link and add expenses` ✅ (newly fixed)

## Currently Failing Tests (4 total)

### 1. complex-unsettled-group.e2e.test.ts (1 test)
- `create group with multiple people and expenses that is NOT settled`

### 2. delete-operations.e2e.test.ts (1 test)
- `should handle multi-user expense visibility`

### 3. multi-user-collaboration.e2e.test.ts (2 tests)
- `should handle group sharing via share link`
- `should allow multiple users to add expenses to same group`

## Failure Categories

### Category 1: Modal Dialog Issues (0 tests) ✅ FIXED
**Tests:** All tests in this category have been fixed!
- ✅ member-management: `should show share functionality`
- ✅ member-management: `should show member in expense split options`

**Pattern:** Tests failing to find or interact with modal dialogs
**Fix:** Added ARIA attributes to modals, updated test selectors to use role-based queries, fixed share link URL pattern

### Category 2: Multi-User Flow Issues (4 tests)
**Tests:**
- complex-unsettled-group: `create group with multiple people and expenses that is NOT settled`
- delete-operations: `should handle multi-user expense visibility`
- multi-user-collaboration: `should handle group sharing via share link`
- multi-user-collaboration: `should allow multiple users to add expenses to same group`
- ✅ ~~multi-user-expenses: `multiple users can join a group via share link and add expenses`~~ (FIXED)

**Pattern:** All tests involving multiple users or group sharing fail (except the basic multi-user expense test which is now passing)

### Category 3: Form/Navigation Issues (0 tests) ✅ FIXED
**Tests:** All tests in this category have been fixed!
- ✅ duplicate-registration: `should show error immediately without clearing form`
- ✅ duplicate-registration: `should allow registration with different email after duplicate attempt`

**Pattern:** Registration form behavior and navigation after errors
**Fix:** Added proper error handling for EMAIL_EXISTS from API, improved navigation after logout

## Progress Update

### Completed Fixes:
1. ✅ Added ARIA attributes to modals (ShareGroupModal and CreateGroupModal)
2. ✅ Updated modal selectors to use proper role-based queries
3. ✅ Fixed multi-user join flow navigation (changed from parsing URL to direct navigation)
4. ✅ Updated MultiUserTestBuilder to properly click "Join Group" button
5. ✅ Removed hardcoded URLs from tests
6. ✅ Fixed duplicate registration error handling (added EMAIL_EXISTS error code support)
7. ✅ Improved navigation after logout in tests
8. ✅ Fixed share modal test by updating URL pattern expectation to match query parameters

### Remaining Issues:
1. **Multi-user flows with share links** - Group sharing via share link tests still failing
2. **Complex group scenarios** - Balance calculation or display issues in complex unsettled groups
3. **Multi-user expense visibility** - Delete operations test failing for multi-user scenarios

## Root Cause Analysis (Updated 2025-08-04)

After analyzing the failing tests and code, I've identified the following root causes:

### 1. **Join Group Redirect Timing Issue**
- The `JoinGroupPage.tsx` has a 1.5 second delay before redirecting to the group page after joining
- Tests are waiting only 1 second (`timeout: 1000`), causing timeout errors
- This affects all join group flow tests

### 2. **Balance Calculation Issue**
- In `complex-unsettled-group.e2e.test.ts`, expenses are created correctly but balances show "All settled up!"
- Two users create expenses ($800 and $120) but the balance calculation isn't working properly
- This suggests a backend issue with balance computation for split expenses

### 3. **Group Member Sync Issue**
- After joining a group, the user count doesn't update (shows "1 members" instead of "2 members")
- The join operation appears successful but the member list isn't refreshed
- This could be a real-time sync issue or API response problem

## Implementation Plan (Revised)

### Phase 1: Fix Join Group Timing Issues (3 tests) - QUICK FIX
**Target Tests:**
- `delete-operations.e2e.test.ts`: "should handle multi-user expense visibility"
- `multi-user-collaboration.e2e.test.ts`: "should handle group sharing via share link"
- `multi-user-collaboration.e2e.test.ts`: "should allow multiple users to add expenses to same group"

**Steps:**
1. Update test timeouts from 1000ms to 2000ms to account for the 1.5s redirect delay
2. Add explicit wait for success message before waiting for navigation
3. Consider reducing the redirect delay in `JoinGroupPage.tsx` from 1500ms to 500ms

### Phase 2: Fix Balance Calculation (1 test) - BACKEND FIX
**Target Test:**
- `complex-unsettled-group.e2e.test.ts`: "create group with multiple people and expenses that is NOT settled"

**Steps:**
1. Investigate balance calculation logic in Firebase functions
2. Check if expenses with equal split are properly calculating member balances
3. Verify the balance aggregation logic handles multiple payers correctly
4. Add logging to trace balance calculation flow

### Phase 3: Fix Member List Sync (Related to Phase 1)
**Steps:**
1. Verify the join group API response includes updated member list
2. Check if the group store properly refreshes member data after join
3. Consider adding a manual refresh after successful join
4. Investigate real-time database listeners for member updates

### Phase 4: Integration and Verification
1. Run all tests with updated timeouts
2. Verify balance calculations work in manual testing
3. Check member list updates in real-time
4. Document any remaining flaky patterns
