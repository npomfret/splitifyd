   - Check for ARIA attributes

2. **Debug Multi-User Flows**
   - Investigate join flow navigation
   - Check session handling between browser contexts
   - Verify share link generation and usage

3. **Fix Form State Management**
   - Ensure form doesn't clear on error
   - Fix navigation timing after logout
