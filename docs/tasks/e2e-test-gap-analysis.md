# E2E Test Gap Analysis Report

**Date:** 2025-08-02

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a comprehensive analysis of the end-to-end (E2E) test suite against the **actually implemented features** of the Splitifyd web application. The goal is to identify gaps in test coverage for existing functionality, areas of over-testing, and opportunities for test redesign to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

The analysis reveals that the existing E2E tests provide a solid foundation, covering critical paths like user authentication, group creation, and basic expense adding. However, several key **implemented features** remain under-tested, and some tests have become redundant or could be consolidated.

**Key Findings:**
- **Good Coverage:** Core features like authentication, group creation, and the basic "add expense" form are well-tested.
- **Major Gaps:** Significant gaps exist in testing for **existing features** like multi-user scenarios, group sharing workflows, and edge cases in the three implemented splitting methods (equal, exact amounts, percentages).
- **Redundancy:** There is some overlap in tests for form validation and basic navigation, which could be streamlined.
- **Opportunity:** The `manual-complex-scenario.e2e.test.ts` and `complex-unsettled-group.e2e.test.ts` tests are valuable but could be redesigned for better automation and clearer assertions.
- **Scope Focus:** This analysis focuses exclusively on testing gaps for features that exist in the codebase, not on wishlist features.

## 2. Untested Features (Gaps)

The following features exist in the codebase but have little to no E2E test coverage. These represent the most significant risks and should be prioritized for new test development.

| Feature | Priority | Recommended Test Scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| **Multi-User Expense Scenarios** | **High** | - Test expenses with multiple participants (3+ users). <br>- Verify balance calculations across multiple users. <br>- Test complex debt relationships in larger groups. |
| **Group Sharing & Joining** | **High** | - Create a shareable group link. <br>- Join a group via shareable link. <br>- Verify member permissions after joining. |
| **Advanced Splitting Edge Cases** | **Medium** | - Test percentage splits that don't equal 100%. <br>- Test exact amount splits that don't equal total. <br>- Verify error handling for invalid split configurations. |
| **Cross-Group Balance Scenarios** | **Medium** | - Create expenses across multiple groups with same users. <br>- Verify individual user balances across different groups. <br>- Test navigation between groups with pending balances. |

## 3. Over-tested Features & Redundancies

Some features are tested in multiple test files, leading to redundancy. While some overlap is acceptable (e.g., creating a group as a prerequisite), we can consolidate some assertions to make the test suite more efficient.

| Area of Redundancy | Files | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **Basic Form Validation** | `auth-flow.e2e.test.ts`, `form-validation.e2e.test.ts`, `add-expense.e2e.test.ts` | Consolidate detailed form validation tests into `form-validation.e2e.test.ts`. Other tests should assume basic validation works and focus on the success path. For example, `add-expense.e2e.test.ts` should focus on the successful creation of an expense, not on testing every validation rule of the form. |
| **Navigation** | `homepage.e2e.test.ts`, `static-pages.e2e.test.ts`, `navigation.e2e.test.ts` | Merge `static-pages.e2e.test.ts` and `navigation.e2e.test.ts` into a single, more comprehensive navigation test file. The homepage test should focus on the elements of the homepage itself, not on navigating away from it. |
| **Group Creation** | `dashboard.e2e.test.ts`, `add-expense.e2e.test.ts`, `group-details.e2e.test.ts`, etc. | Group creation is a necessary setup step for many tests. However, we should create a helper function or a fixture to handle group creation, rather than repeating the UI steps in every test file. This will make the tests faster and less brittle. |
| **Basic Expense Creation** | Multiple test files | The basic "add expense with equal split" flow is tested in several files. Create a helper function for basic expense creation and focus individual tests on specific splitting methods or edge cases. |

## 4. Opportunities for Test Redesign

Certain tests, while valuable, could be improved to provide more reliable and meaningful results.

| Test File | Area for Improvement | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| `manual-complex-scenario.e2e.test.ts` | **Automation & Assertions** | This test performs many actions but has very few assertions. It should be broken down into smaller, more focused tests with clear `expect` statements. For example, create separate tests for multi-user expense submission, balance verification, and group sharing workflows. |
| `complex-unsettled-group.e2e.test.ts` | **Clarity & Focus** | Similar to the manual scenario, this test is long and complex. It should be refactored to test a specific complex scenario, such as a multi-user group with multiple expenses using different split types, and then assert the final balance calculations are correct. |
| `*-placeholder.e2e.test.ts` | **Implementation** | Several tests are placeholders that pass whether the feature is implemented or not. These should be updated with concrete assertions to verify the functionality they are intended to test. |

## 5. Recommendations & Action Plan

1.  **Prioritize Gap Coverage:** Begin by writing E2E tests for the "High" priority untested features, starting with **Multi-User Expense Scenarios** and **Group Sharing & Joining**.
2.  **Consolidate Redundant Tests:** Refactor the navigation and form validation tests as recommended above to reduce redundancy.
3.  **Create Helper Functions:** Develop a helper function or fixture for common setup tasks like user login and group creation to streamline tests.
4.  **Redesign Complex Scenarios:** Break down the `manual-complex-scenario` and `complex-unsettled-group` tests into smaller, more focused, and fully automated tests.
5.  **Remove Placeholders:** Update placeholder tests with concrete assertions.

By addressing these gaps and opportunities, we can build a more robust, efficient, and reliable E2E test suite that provides greater confidence in the quality of the Splitifyd application.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Test Infrastructure (Foundation)

#### 1.1 Create Common Test Helpers
**File:** `e2e-tests/helpers/test-helpers.ts`
**Purpose:** Reduce redundancy by creating reusable helper functions
**Functions to implement:**
- `createTestGroup(page, groupName, description?)` - Creates a group and returns group ID
- `addTestExpense(page, groupId, amount, description, splitType, splitData?)` - Adds expense via UI
- `getGroupBalances(page, groupId)` - Retrieves current balance state
- `createShareableLink(page, groupId)` - Creates shareable group link
- `joinGroupViaLink(page, shareableLink)` - Joins group via link
- `waitForBalanceUpdate(page)` - Waits for balance recalculation

**Commit:** "test: add common helper functions for e2e tests"

#### 1.2 Create Test Data Builders
**File:** `e2e-tests/helpers/test-data-builders.ts`
**Purpose:** Generate consistent test data following the builder pattern
**Builders to implement:**
- `GroupBuilder` - For creating test groups with various configurations
- `ExpenseBuilder` - For creating expenses with different split types (equal, exact, percentage)
- `UserBuilder` - For creating test users with different roles

**Commit:** "test: add test data builders for e2e tests"

### Phase 2: High Priority Feature Tests

3. Test splits with very small amounts (rounding behavior)
4. Test splits with zero amounts for some participants
5. Verify error messages for invalid split configurations

**Commit:** "test: add splitting edge cases e2e tests"

### Phase 3: Medium Priority Feature Tests

#### 3.1 Cross-Group Balance Scenarios Tests
**File:** `e2e-tests/tests/cross-group-balances.e2e.test.ts`
**Test scenarios:**
1. Create expenses across multiple groups with same users
2. Verify individual user balances are isolated per group
3. Test navigation between groups with different balance states
4. Verify group deletion doesn't affect other group balances

**Commit:** "test: add cross-group balance scenarios e2e tests"

### Phase 4: Test Consolidation

#### 4.1 Consolidate Navigation Tests
**Action:** Merge redundant navigation tests
- Keep `navigation.e2e.test.ts` as the main navigation test
- Move static page checks from `homepage.e2e.test.ts` and `static-pages.e2e.test.ts`
- Remove redundant files after consolidation

**Commit:** "test: consolidate navigation e2e tests"

#### 4.2 Consolidate Form Validation Tests
**Action:** Centralize validation tests
- Keep detailed validation in `form-validation.e2e.test.ts`
- Remove validation checks from `auth-flow.e2e.test.ts` and `add-expense.e2e.test.ts`
- Focus other tests on success paths only

**Commit:** "test: consolidate form validation e2e tests"

#### 4.3 Refactor Complex Scenario Tests
**Files to refactor:**
- `manual-complex-scenario.e2e.test.ts`
- `complex-unsettled-group.e2e.test.ts`

**Action:** Break into smaller, focused tests with clear assertions
- Extract multi-user balance verification test
- Extract group sharing workflow test
- Extract complex splitting scenarios test
- Add specific assertions for each step

**Commit:** "test: refactor complex scenario tests into focused tests"

### Success Metrics
- Test execution time reduced by 30% through helper functions
- Zero redundant test cases
- All tests have meaningful assertions
- Test failures clearly indicate what feature is broken
- New features can be tested by combining existing helpers

### Implementation Order
