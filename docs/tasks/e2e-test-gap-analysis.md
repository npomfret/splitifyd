### E2E Test Coverage Gap Analysis Report

**Summary:**
The current E2E test suite provides good coverage for the creation and basic interaction with core features like groups, expenses, and settlements. However, it appears to be missing tests for several critical "update" and "delete" user flows, as well as user profile management.

**Obvious Missing Test Cases:**

1.  **Group Management Lifecycle:**
    *   **Editing a Group:** There are no tests for editing a group's name or description after it has been created. This is a standard feature that needs to be verified.
    *   **Deleting a Group:** The full lifecycle of a group should be tested, including its deletion by the group owner/admin.

2.  **Member Management Lifecycle:**
    *   **Leaving a Group:** A user who has joined a group should have a way to leave it. There are no tests covering this "leave group" functionality.
    *   **Removing a Member:** A group admin should be able to remove another member from the group. This is a critical administrative function that is not currently tested.

3.  **Expense Management Lifecycle:**
    *   **Editing an Expense:** While there is a test for editing an expense *category*, there isn't a general test for editing the primary details of an expense, such as its description or amount.

4.  **User Profile Management:**
    *   **Profile Updates:** There are no tests for a user managing their own profile. This would include test cases for:
        *   Changing their display name.
        *   Changing their password.
        *   Updating their email address (if supported).

These missing tests represent significant gaps in the "happy path" coverage for standard application features. Adding them would provide a more complete and robust validation of the application's functionality.

### Implementation Status Verification

**Date:** 2025-08-09

**Summary:**
A thorough review of the TypeScript codebase (`*.ts`, `*.tsx`) was conducted to verify the implementation status of the features identified as having test coverage gaps. The analysis confirms that the E2E Test Coverage Gap Analysis Report is accurate. The features listed are either not implemented or only partially implemented, validating the need for the suggested E2E tests once the features are complete.

**Detailed Findings:**

1.  **Group Management Lifecycle:**
    *   **Editing a Group:** Backend logic for updating a group's name or description exists in `firebase/functions/src/groups/handlers.ts`. However, there is **no corresponding UI** in the `webapp-v2` components to allow a user to perform this action.
    *   **Deleting a Group:** Backend logic for deleting a group exists and includes a check to prevent deletion if the group has expenses. However, there is **no UI functionality** to trigger this action.

2.  **Member Management Lifecycle:**
    *   **Leaving a Group:** This functionality is **not implemented** in either the backend API or the frontend UI.
    *   **Removing a Member:** This functionality is **not implemented** in either the backend API or the frontend UI.

3.  **Expense Management Lifecycle:**
    *   **Editing an Expense:** The core functionality for editing an expense (including amount and description) is present in both the backend (`firebase/functions/src/expenses/handlers.ts`) and the frontend (`webapp-v2/src/pages/AddExpensePage.tsx` in edit mode). The gap analysis is correct that the existing E2E tests are not comprehensive and only cover category changes.

4.  **User Profile Management:**
    *   **Profile Updates:** There is **no implementation** for users to manage their own profile (e.g., changing display name, password, or email). The `firebase/functions/src/services/userService.ts` exists but does not contain update logic, and there are no corresponding UI components.

**Conclusion:**
The E2E test gap analysis is correct. No changes will be made to the list of missing test cases, as they accurately represent the current state of the application's features and test coverage.
