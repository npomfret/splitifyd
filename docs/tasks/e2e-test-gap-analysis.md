### E2E Test Coverage Gap Analysis Report

**Summary:**
The current E2E test suite provides good coverage for the creation and basic interaction with core features like groups, expenses, and settlements. However, it appears to be missing tests for several critical "update" and "delete" user flows, as well as user profile management.

**Obvious Missing Test Cases:**

1.  **Group Management Lifecycle:**
    *   **Editing a Group:** There are no tests for editing a group's name or description after it has been created. This is a standard feature that needs to be verified.
    *   **Deleting a Group:** The full lifecycle of a group should be tested, including its deletion by the group owner/admin.

2.  **Member Management Lifecycle:**
    *   **Leaving a Group:** A user who has joined a group should have a way to leave it. There are no tests covering this "leave group" functionality.
    *   **Removing a Member:** A group admin should be able to remove another member from the group. This is a critical administrative function that is not currently tested.

3.  **Expense Management Lifecycle:**
    *   **Editing an Expense:** While there is a test for editing an expense *category*, there isn't a general test for editing the primary details of an expense, such as its description or amount.

4.  **User Profile Management:**
    *   **Profile Updates:** There are no tests for a user managing their own profile. This would include test cases for:
        *   Changing their display name.
        *   Changing their password.
        *   Updating their email address (if supported).

These missing tests represent significant gaps in the "happy path" coverage for standard application features. Adding them would provide a more complete and robust validation of the application's functionality.
