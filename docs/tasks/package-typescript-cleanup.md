# Minimal TypeScript Cleanup - Implementation

## What Was Actually Broken

1. **Non-existent shared-types references**
   - `webapp/tsconfig.json` and `firebase/functions/tsconfig.json` referenced `@bill-splitter/shared-types`
   - The `shared-types` directory didn't exist
   - This caused TypeScript resolution errors

2. **Inconsistent TypeScript versions**
   - webapp-v2: 5.3.3 (outdated)
   - webapp: 5.7.2
   - firebase/functions, firebase, root: 5.8.3
   - This could cause type incompatibilities and different compiler behavior

3. **Wrong module config in webapp**
   - webapp/tsconfig.json had `module: "ES2020"` but the package uses CommonJS

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed broken shared-types references
- ✅ Removed `paths` entries from `webapp/tsconfig.json`
- ✅ Removed `paths` entries from `firebase/functions/tsconfig.json`

### 2. Updated TypeScript versions to 5.8.3
- ✅ Updated webapp-v2 from 5.3.3 to 5.8.3
- ✅ Updated webapp from 5.7.2 to 5.8.3

### 3. Fixed webapp module config
- ✅ Changed `module: "ES2020"` to `module: "commonjs"` in webapp/tsconfig.json

## What Was NOT Done (and why)

Following the engineering directives to avoid overengineering and do only what's needed:

- ❌ No shared utilities or build scripts (unnecessary abstraction)
- ❌ No dependency hoisting (adds complexity without clear benefit)
- ❌ No test infrastructure changes (existing setup works)
- ❌ No root TypeScript config (not needed, could add complexity)
- ❌ No TypeScript project references (overengineering for current needs)
- ❌ No documentation for module strategy (code is self-documenting)

## Result

The codebase now has:
- Consistent TypeScript version (5.8.3) across all packages
- No broken import references
- Correct module configuration for each package's needs

That's it. Just fixed what was broken, nothing more.
