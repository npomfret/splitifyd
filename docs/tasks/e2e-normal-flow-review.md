# E2E Normal Flow Test Analysis Report

This report details the findings from a deep dive into the `e2e-tests/src/tests/normal-flow` test suite. The analysis focused on ensuring each test case is accurately and robustly testing its intended functionality.

## General Observations

- **Overall Health:** The majority of the tests are well-structured and correctly use fixtures and page objects.
- **Common Issue:** The most common issue is a reliance on simple visibility checks (`.toBeVisible()`) without verifying the *content* or *state* of the element. This can lead to tests that pass even if the UI is displaying incorrect data.
- **Readability:** Some tests could be improved by adding comments to explain complex calculations or business logic being tested.

## File-by-File Analysis

### `balance-visualization.e2e.test.ts`

- **Issue:** In the `'should show settled up when both users pay equal amounts'` test, the assertion `multiUserExpected(groupDetailPage.getSettledUpMessage()).toBeVisible()` is not robust enough. It checks for the visibility of the message, but it would be better to check for the *absence* of any debt messages.
- **Recommendation:** Add an assertion to ensure that no debt messages (e.g., `getByText(/owes/)`) are visible in the balances section.

- **Issue:** The test `'should handle currency formatting in debt amounts'` uses a regular expression `getByText(/\$61\.7[23]/)` to account for rounding. While this works, it's not ideal because it's not deterministic. The test should calculate the expected value and assert that the UI matches it.
- **Recommendation:** Calculate the exact expected debt amount (including rounding) and assert against that specific value. This may require a helper function to replicate the application's rounding logic.

### `group-display.e2e.test.ts`

- **Issue:** The test `'should display correct initial state for a new group'` asserts that the group title contains the group name (`toContainText(groupName)`). This is not a strict enough check.
- **Recommendation:** The assertion should be changed to check for the exact group name (`toHaveText(groupName)`).

### `multi-user-happy-path.e2e.test.ts`

- **Issue:** The test `'balances update correctly with multiple users and expenses'` has a weak assertion for the balance update. It only checks that the word "owes" is present. It does not verify the amount of the debt or who owes whom.
- **Recommendation:** The test should calculate the expected debt and make a specific assertion, for example: `expect(page.getByText('User B owes User A')).toBeVisible()` and `expect(page.getByText('$50.00')).toBeVisible()`.

### `settlement-management.e2e.test.ts`

- **Issue:** The test `'should handle multiple currencies'` only verifies that the text "EUR" is visible in the history. It does not verify the amount of the settlement.
- **Recommendation:** The test should also assert that the correct settlement amount is displayed next to the currency.

### `three-user-settlement.e2e.test.ts`

- **Issue:** This is a very complex test, and while it appears to be functionally correct, it is difficult to follow the calculations. The assertions are correct, but the setup is hard to understand.
- **Recommendation:** Add comments to the test to explain the expected debt calculations at each step. This will make the test easier to maintain.

### `negative-value-validation.e2e.test.ts`

- **Issue:** The test `'should prevent negative expense amounts in UI'` correctly checks for the `min` attribute on the input, but it also relies on the browser's validation message. This is good, but it could be more robust.
- **Recommendation:** In addition to the existing checks, the test should also assert that the "Save Expense" button is disabled when a negative value is entered.

## Conclusion

The `normal-flow` tests are in good shape, but the identified issues should be addressed to improve the robustness and clarity of the test suite. The most critical changes are those that strengthen the assertions to be more specific and less reliant on simple visibility checks.
