## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Analysis Summary
After analyzing the existing codebase:

1. ✅ **Full API support available**:
   - GET `/groups/:id` - Fetch group details
   - GET `/expenses/group` - Fetch expenses with pagination
   - GET `/groups/balances` - Get balance calculations
   - POST `/expenses` - Create new expense
   - PUT/DELETE `/expenses` - Update/delete expenses

2. ✅ **Type definitions complete**:
   - GroupDetail, ExpenseData, GroupBalances types defined
   - User and balance types ready
   - All request/response types available

3. ✅ **Infrastructure ready**:
   - Groups store pattern established
   - API client with auth working
   - UI components library available
   - Router ready for new routes

4. ❌ **Missing components**:
   - No group detail page yet
   - No expense-related components
   - No balance display components
   - No member management UI

### Implementation Strategy

**Chosen Approach: Feature-Based Implementation**
1. Start with basic group detail display (read-only)
2. Add expense list with pagination
3. Implement balance calculations display
4. Add member management features
5. Enable expense CRUD operations last

This approach ensures we have a working page early and can incrementally add features.

### Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

#### Phase 1: Group Detail Store & Basic Page (2 hours)
**Purpose**: Create foundation for group detail functionality

**Implementation**:
1. **Create `src/app/stores/group-detail-store.ts`**
   ```typescript
   interface GroupDetailStore {
     group: GroupDetail | null;
     expenses: ExpenseData[];
     balances: GroupBalances | null;
     loading: boolean;
     error: string | null;
     
     fetchGroup(id: string): Promise<void>;
     fetchExpenses(cursor?: string): Promise<void>;
     fetchBalances(): Promise<void>;
     reset(): void;
   }
   ```

2. **Create `src/pages/GroupDetailPage.tsx`**
   - Route params handling for group ID
   - Loading states while data fetches
   - Error handling for invalid groups
   - Basic layout structure

3. **Add route to App.tsx**:
   ```tsx
   <Route path="/groups/:id" component={GroupDetailPage} />
   ```

#### Phase 2: Group Header & Info Display (1.5 hours)
**Purpose**: Display group information and quick stats

**Implementation**:
1. **Create `src/components/group/GroupHeader.tsx`**
   - Group name and description
   - Member count and avatars preview
   - Total expense count
   - Created date
   - Settings button (placeholder)

2. **Create `src/components/group/MembersList.tsx`**
   - Display all members with avatars
   - Show member names and emails
   - Indicate group creator
   - Placeholder for member actions

3. **Styling approach**:
   - Use existing Card component for sections
   - Consistent spacing with Stack component
   - Mobile-responsive grid for members

#### Phase 3: Expense List Implementation (2 hours)
**Purpose**: Display paginated expense list

**Implementation**:
1. **Create `src/components/group/ExpensesList.tsx`**
   - Fetch expenses on mount
   - Handle pagination with "Load More" button
   - Show loading state for pagination
   - Empty state when no expenses

2. **Create `src/components/group/ExpenseItem.tsx`**
   - Expense description and amount
   - Paid by indicator
   - Date formatting
   - Category icon/badge
   - Participants list
   - Click handler for detail view (placeholder)

3. **Features**:
   - Virtual scrolling for performance (phase 2)
   - Search/filter (phase 2)
   - Sort options (phase 2)

#### Phase 4: Balance Display (2 hours)
**Purpose**: Show who owes whom

**Implementation**:
1. **Create `src/components/group/BalanceSummary.tsx`**
   - Fetch balances from API
   - Display user's personal balance prominently
   - Show simplified debts list
   - Color coding (red for owing, green for owed)

2. **Create `src/components/group/BalanceItem.tsx`**
   - Individual balance display
   - "Person A owes Person B $X" format
   - Settle button (placeholder)
   - Amount formatting with currency

3. **Balance calculation display**:
   - Use the API's pre-calculated balances
   - Don't recalculate client-side (trust server)
   - Handle multi-currency gracefully

#### Phase 5: Quick Actions & Polish (1.5 hours)
**Purpose**: Add interactivity and polish

**Implementation**:
1. **Create `src/components/group/QuickActions.tsx`**
   - Add Expense button (navigate to add page)
   - Settle Up button (placeholder)
   - Share Group button (placeholder)
   - Leave Group option (placeholder)

2. **Error handling improvements**:
   - Network error retry buttons
   - Permission denied messages
   - Group not found redirect

3. **Performance optimizations**:
   - Debounce scroll events
   - Lazy load member avatars
   - Cache group data in store

### Technical Decisions

1. **State Management**: 
   - Separate group-detail-store for this page
   - Don't pollute groups-store with detail data
   - Clear store on unmount to prevent stale data

2. **Data Fetching**:
   - Parallel fetch group, expenses, and balances
   - Show partial data as it arrives
   - Implement proper error boundaries

3. **Navigation**:
   - Add expense → `/groups/:id/add-expense`
   - Expense detail → `/groups/:id/expenses/:expenseId`
   - Back to dashboard preserves scroll position

4. **Mobile First**:
   - Stack layout on mobile
   - Side-by-side on desktop
   - Touch-friendly tap targets

### Commit Strategy

**Commit 1**: Group detail store and basic page (2 hours) ✅ COMPLETED
- group-detail-store.ts implementation
- GroupDetailPage with routing  
- Basic data fetching
- All sections in monolithic page (to be extracted later)
- Expense pagination
- Balance display
- Member grid
- Quick actions toolbar (placeholders)
- Error and loading states
- dateUtils for formatting

**Future Commits** (Component extraction):
- Extract GroupHeader component
- Extract MembersList component  
- Extract ExpensesList component
- Extract ExpenseItem component
- Extract BalanceSummary component
- Extract QuickActions component
- Add member management functionality
- Add real-time subscriptions

### Future Enhancements (Not in MVP)
1. Real-time updates via Firestore listeners
2. Expense search and filtering
3. Member management (add/remove)
4. Group settings editing
5. Expense bulk operations
6. Export functionality

## Timeline

- Start Date: When instructed
- End Date: Same day
- Duration: ~9 hours (detailed breakdown above)
- **Ready to implement** ✅

## Notes

- Most complex page - taking incremental approach
- Balance calculations handled by API - no client-side math
- Real-time features deferred to phase 2
- Focus on solid foundation with good UX

## Implementation Notes (Phase 1)

The initial implementation created a fully functional group detail page as a monolithic component. This approach was chosen to:
1. Get a working page quickly to validate the data flow
2. Ensure all pieces work together before componentization
3. Allow for easier refactoring once the full picture is clear

The page currently includes all functionality inline within GroupDetailPage.tsx:
- Group header with stats
- Member grid display
- Balance summary from API
- Paginated expense list
- Quick action buttons (placeholders)

Next steps would be to extract each section into its own component for better maintainability and reusability.
