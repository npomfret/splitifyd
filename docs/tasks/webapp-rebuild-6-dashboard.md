- No real-time data sync
- Basic warning banner system

## Target State
- Reactive dashboard with real-time updates
- Clean component-based group cards
- Automatic data sync
- Loading states and error handling
- Enhanced user experience

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Analysis Summary
After analyzing the existing infrastructure, I found:

1. ✅ **Firebase/Firestore fully integrated** - Complete backend API exists
2. ✅ **Groups API endpoints available** - Full CRUD operations implemented
3. ✅ **Authentication working** - Auth store and Firebase auth ready  
4. ✅ **Type-safe client ready** - apiClient with groups methods exists
5. ❌ **Missing groups store** - Need state management layer for groups
6. ❌ **No dashboard UI yet** - Ready to build with existing infrastructure

### Implementation Strategy

**Chosen Approach: Store-First Pattern**
1. Create groups store similar to auth-store pattern
2. Build reusable dashboard components  
3. Implement real-time sync later (MVP first)
4. Focus on excellent UX with loading states

### Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

#### Phase 1: Groups Store Foundation (2 hours)
**Purpose**: Create reactive groups state management

**Implementation:**
1. **Create `src/app/stores/groups-store.ts`**
   - Follow exact pattern from `auth-store.ts` (proven architecture)
   - Use Preact signals for reactive state  
   - Handle loading, error, and data states
   - Implement CRUD operations with API integration

2. **Store interface:**
   ```typescript
   interface GroupsStore {
     groups: Group[];
     loading: boolean; 
     error: string | null;
     fetchGroups(): Promise<void>;
     createGroup(data: CreateGroupData): Promise<Group>;
     updateGroup(id: string, data: UpdateGroupData): Promise<void>;
     deleteGroup(id: string): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

3. **Error handling strategy:**
   - Network errors: Clear messaging, retry options
   - Auth errors: Redirect to login
   - Validation errors: Field-specific feedback
   - Server errors: Generic error message

#### Phase 2: Dashboard Page Component (1 hour)  
**Purpose**: Main dashboard layout and routing

**Implementation:**
1. **Create `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`**
   - Route protection (redirect if not authenticated)
   - Loading state while groups fetch
   - Error boundary for graceful failures
   - Mobile-responsive layout

2. **Page sections:**
   - Header with user welcome message
   - Groups list as primary content
   - Empty state when no groups
   - Create group CTA

3. **Route integration:**
   - Add route to App.tsx: `/dashboard`
   - Update login redirect target
   - Handle deep linking properly

#### Phase 3: Groups List Component (1.5 hours)
**Purpose**: Display and manage groups list

**Implementation:**
1. **Create `src/components/dashboard/GroupsList.tsx`**
   - Iterate over groups from store
   - Handle loading/error states
   - Sort by most recent activity
   - Search functionality (client-side initially)

2. **Create `src/components/dashboard/GroupCard.tsx`**
   - Reuse existing UI components (Card from ui library)
   - Group name, member count, recent activity
   - Click to navigate to group detail (placeholder route)
   - Balance indicator with color coding
   - Member avatars (initials for MVP)

3. **Accessibility features:**
   - Proper semantic structure
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader announcements
   - Focus management

#### Phase 4: Group Creation (1.5 hours)
**Purpose**: Allow users to create new groups

**Implementation:**
1. **Create `src/components/dashboard/CreateGroupModal.tsx`**
   - Modal dialog using existing UI components
   - Group name input (required)
   - Description field (optional)
   - Form validation
   - Success/error feedback

2. **Create group flow:**
   - Open modal from dashboard CTA
   - Validate form client-side
   - Call groups store createGroup method
   - Optimistic update (add group immediately)
   - Navigate to new group on success
   - Handle errors gracefully

3. **UX enhancements:**
   - Auto-focus name input
   - Enter to submit
   - Escape to close
   - Loading spinner during creation

#### Phase 5: Dashboard Features & Polish (2 hours)
**Purpose**: Complete dashboard functionality

**Implementation:**
1. **User info section:**
   - Display current user name/email from auth store
   - Account settings placeholder link
   - Logout functionality
   - User avatar (initials)

2. **Empty state component:**
   - Friendly message when no groups
   - Clear CTA to create first group
   - Getting started tips
   - Illustrations/icons for visual appeal

3. **Error handling:**
   - Network error retry mechanism
   - Authentication error redirect
   - Generic error boundary
   - Toast notifications for actions

4. **Performance optimizations:**
   - Lazy loading for large group lists
   - Debounced search
   - Optimistic updates
   - Proper loading states

### Technical Decisions

1. **State Management**: Preact signals (consistent with auth-store)
2. **API Integration**: Existing apiClient (proven working)
3. **Real-time Updates**: Phase 2 feature (build solid foundation first) 
4. **UI Components**: Leverage existing ui library components
5. **Routing**: Add to existing router setup
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback

### Risk Mitigation

1. **API Integration**: Use existing proven apiClient 
2. **State Management**: Follow exact auth-store pattern
3. **Authentication**: Proper route guards and error handling
4. **Performance**: Build with scalability in mind
5. **User Experience**: Clear loading states and error messages

### Commit Strategy

**Commit 1**: Groups store foundation (1.5 hours)
- Groups store implementation following auth-store pattern exactly
- Basic state management with Preact signals
- API integration with existing apiClient
- Validate early, fail fast on API errors

**Commit 2**: Dashboard page with groups display (2 hours) 
- DashboardPage component with route protection
- GroupsList and GroupCard components (no extraction - inline first)
- Display real groups from API
- Loading and error states with clear messages

**Commit 3**: Group creation functionality (1.5 hours)
- CreateGroupModal component
- Form validation (fail fast, clear errors)
- Create group through store
- Navigate to new group on success

**Commit 4**: Final polish and cleanup (1 hour)
- Extract components if needed
- Empty state for no groups
- User info section with logout
- Remove any debug logs or comments

This approach ensures each commit is independently valuable and testable.

### What NOT to Do (Per Directives)

1. **No overengineering**:
   - Don't add features not in the spec (no search, no filtering, no sorting yet)
   - Don't create generic abstractions or helper functions
   - Don't add "nice to have" features

2. **No fallbacks or backward compatibility**:
   - Trust the API data structure - don't add fallbacks
   - If data is wrong, fix it upstream (in the API)
   - Validate early and fail with clear errors

3. **No extra work**:
   - Don't implement real-time updates (that's a future phase)
   - Don't add pagination (API doesn't support it yet)
   - Don't create a generic modal system

4. **Code quality**:
   - No comments unless something is truly weird
   - No console.log statements (use logger if needed)
   - No try/catch/log patterns - let errors bubble up
