# E2E Normal Flow Test Analysis Report (Second Pass)

This report details the findings from a second deep dive into the `e2e-tests/src/tests/normal-flow` test suite. This analysis confirms that many issues from the previous report have been fixed, but some areas for improvement remain.

## General Observations

- **Positive Progress:** A significant number of bespoke selectors have been refactored into the Page Object Model (POM), improving test maintainability and readability. The overall health of the test suite is much improved.
- **Remaining Issue:** The primary remaining issue is the robustness of assertions. Many tests still rely on simple visibility checks (`.toBeVisible()`) instead of verifying the specific content or state of an element. This can lead to tests passing even when incorrect data is displayed.

## File-by-File Analysis

### `balance-visualization.e2e.test.ts`

- **Issue:** The test `'should show settled up when both users pay equal amounts'` now correctly uses a `hasSettledUpMessage()` helper, which is an improvement. However, to be fully robust, it should also explicitly assert the *absence* of any debt messages.
- **Recommendation:** Add an assertion to confirm that no debt-related text (e.g., `/owes/` or `â†’`) is present in the balances section when the group should be settled.

- **Issue:** The test `'should handle currency formatting in debt amounts'` still uses a regular expression (`hasDebtAmountPattern(/\$61\.7[23]/)`) to handle rounding. This is not deterministic.
- **Recommendation:** The test should calculate the precise expected debt amount, including the application's rounding logic, and assert against that exact value. This might require a shared helper function.

### `multi-user-happy-path.e2e.test.ts`

- **Issue:** The test `'balances update correctly with multiple users and expenses'` has been improved, but the assertion for the balance update is still not as specific as it could be. It checks for the presence of the debt relationship but not the amount.
- **Recommendation:** The test should calculate the expected debt and assert the specific amount is visible (e.g., `expect(groupDetailPage.hasDebtAmount('$50.00')).toBe(true)`).

### `settlement-management.e2e.test.ts`

- **Issue:** The test `'should handle multiple currencies'` still only verifies that the text "EUR" is visible. It does not confirm the settlement amount.
- **Recommendation:** Add an assertion to verify that the correct settlement amount (e.g., `100.00`) is displayed alongside the currency indicator.

### `three-user-settlement.e2e.test.ts`

- **Status:** This complex test remains functionally correct. The logic is sound.
- **Recommendation:** The recommendation to add comments explaining the debt calculations at each step still stands. This would greatly improve the maintainability of this test.

### `negative-value-validation.e2e.test.ts`

- **Status:** This file has seen significant improvement and now uses the POM for most selectors.
- **Issue:** The test `'should prevent negative expense amounts in UI'` still has a mix of direct interaction (`.fill('-50')`) and POM usage. While this is for testing the validation, it could be made more consistent.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure all interactions, where possible, are abstracted through the POM, even for negative test cases. The POM methods can have variants for entering invalid data if needed.

### `member-display.e2e.test.ts`

- **Issue:** The test `'should show member in expense split options'` still contains several bespoke selectors for verifying the split options.
- **Recommendation:** These selectors (`splitHeading.locator('..').locator('..')`, `splitCard.locator(SELECTORS.CHECKBOX).first()`, etc.) should be moved into the `GroupDetailPage` page object.

## Conclusion

Excellent progress has been made in refactoring the `normal-flow` test suite. The remaining issues are generally minor and focus on making assertions more specific and robust. Prioritizing the strengthening of assertions will make the test suite even more reliable at catching regressions.
