# Task: Free-form Expense Categories with Suggestions

**Status:** Completed

## Description

This task is to change the expense category input from a rigid dropdown to a flexible, free-form text field. To maintain usability, the field should display a list of suggested categories when the user focuses on it. The user will be able to select a suggestion or type a custom category.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The "Category" field on the "Add/Edit Expense" form is a text input field, not a `<select>` dropdown.
- When the category input field receives focus, a dropdown appears beneath it.
- The dropdown contains a predefined list of standard categories (e.g., "Food", "Transport", "Utilities", "Entertainment", "Shopping").
- The user can type any text into the input field, even if it's not in the suggestion list.
- The backend API for creating/updating expenses accepts a string for the `category` field (with reasonable length validation, e.g., 1-50 characters).
- Selecting an option from the suggestion dropdown populates the input field with that value.

## Future Enhancements

- The suggestion dropdown will query existing expenses in the current group and display the most frequently used categories at the top of the list.
- The suggestions will be filtered as the user types.

# Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

The current implementation uses:
- **Frontend**: A rigid `<select>` dropdown with predefined categories from `EXPENSE_CATEGORIES` (webapp-v2/src/app/stores/expense-form-store.ts:354-364)
- **Backend**: Joi validation that only accepts predefined categories from `EXPENSE_CATEGORIES` constant (firebase/functions/src/expenses/validation.ts:44)
- **Data Flow**: Category field is a string but limited to predefined values in validation

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Backend Changes
1. **Update validation schema** (firebase/functions/src/expenses/validation.ts:44):
   - Remove strict category validation from Joi schema
   - Add length validation (1-50 characters) and sanitization
   - Keep input sanitization for security

2. **Update category constants** (firebase/functions/src/types/firebase-config-types.ts):
   - Keep existing categories as suggestions, not validation rules

### Phase 2: Frontend Component Development  
3. **Create CategorySuggestionInput component**:
   - Text input field with dropdown suggestions
   - Show suggestions on focus/typing
   - Support keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, escape)
   - Allow custom text input beyond suggestions
   - Use existing UI components (Input, focus styles from current theme)

4. **Update expense form store** (webapp-v2/src/app/stores/expense-form-store.ts):
   - Keep category as string field
   - Update recent categories tracking to work with any string

### Phase 3: Integration
5. **Update AddExpensePage** (webapp-v2/src/pages/AddExpensePage.tsx:354-365):
   - Replace `<select>` with new CategorySuggestionInput
   - Maintain existing validation error handling
   - Keep existing form layout and styling

6. **Update ExpenseDetailPage** if needed:
   - Ensure custom categories display properly

### Phase 4: Testing Updates
7. **Update E2E tests**:
   - Modify tests that use `categorySelect.selectOption()` 
   - Add tests for custom category input
   - Test suggestion selection vs. free-form input

8. **Add component tests**:
   - CategorySuggestionInput functionality
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Custom input handling

## Technical Design

### CategorySuggestionInput Component Props:
```typescript
interface CategorySuggestionInputProps {
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
  suggestions: Array<{name: string, displayName: string, icon: string}>;
  className?: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Key Features:
- **Suggestions Display**: Dropdown shows when focused, filters as user types
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select, Escape to close
- **Custom Input**: User can type any text, not limited to suggestions
- **Visual Design**: Consistent with existing form styling
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard support

## Benefits:
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility (existing categories still work)
- ✅ Allows user flexibility for custom categories  
- ✅ Provides guided UX with suggestions
- ✅ Minimal backend changes (just validation relaxation)
- ✅ Future-ready for dynamic suggestions from user data

## Files to Modify:
- `firebase/functions/src/expenses/validation.ts` - Relax category validation
- `webapp-v2/src/components/ui/CategorySuggestionInput.tsx` - New component  
- `webapp-v2/src/pages/AddExpensePage.tsx` - Replace select with new component
- `e2e-tests/src/tests/normal-flow/add-expense-happy-path.e2e.test.ts` - Update tests
- Test files for new component
