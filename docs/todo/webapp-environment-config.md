# Webapp Issue: Environment-Specific Configurations - COMPLETED

## Issue Description

The system previously used client-side environment detection by checking `window.location.hostname` and build-time environment variable injection. This approach was brittle, lacked scalability, posed security risks, and was inflexible.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED - Runtime Configuration

The environment-specific configuration system has been migrated to a **runtime configuration approach**:

### What Was Done

1. **Removed Build-Time Configuration**
   - Deleted `.env.development` and `.env.production` files
   - Removed `scripts/build.js` that injected environment variables at build time
   - Updated `package.json` to use `esbuild.config.js` directly

2. **Enhanced Server Configuration Endpoint**
   - The `/api/config` endpoint now provides all configuration data including:
     - Firebase configuration
     - API endpoints
     - Environment settings
     - Feature flags
     - Form defaults (for development)
     - Warning banners

3. **Created Runtime Configuration Manager**
   - `firebase-config-manager.ts` fetches configuration from the server at runtime
   - Implements caching and retry logic for reliability
   - Provides typed access to configuration values

4. **Updated All Configuration Consumers**
   - `config.ts` now uses `firebaseConfigManager` instead of environment variables
   - `firebase-init.ts` fetches Firebase config from the API
   - `api-client.ts` gets API endpoints from runtime configuration
   - All components initialize after configuration is loaded

### Benefits of Runtime Configuration

1. **Security**: No sensitive configuration in client-side code
2. **Flexibility**: Configuration can be changed without rebuilding
3. **Environment Agnostic**: Same build works in all environments
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Configuration can be updated server-side
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for configuration

### Architecture

┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │────▶│ /api/config  │────▶│   Server    │
│  (Browser)  │     │   Endpoint   │     │   Config    │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       │                                         │

┌─────────────────┐                    ┌─────────────────┐
│ FirebaseConfig  │                    │ Environment     │
│    Manager      │                    │ Variables       │
└─────────────────┘                    └─────────────────┘
```

### Configuration Flow

1. Client loads the application
2. `firebase-config-manager.ts` fetches configuration from `/api/config`
3. Configuration is cached and made available to all components
4. Components initialize using the runtime configuration

### Migration Notes

The old build-time environment variable system has been completely removed. All configuration now comes from the server at runtime, making the application more secure and easier to deploy across different environments.
