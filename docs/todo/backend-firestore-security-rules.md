# Backend Issue: Firestore Security Rules

## Issue Description

Firestore Security Rules are crucial for both security and cost control. Without strict rules, unauthorized or malicious users can run expensive queries, driving up the bill.

## Recommendation

Implement strict Firestore Security Rules. This is not just for security; it's a cost-control measure that prevents unauthorized or malicious users from running expensive queries that could drive up your bill.

## Implementation Suggestions

This is a backend (Firebase Functions) issue, specifically related to `firestore.rules`.

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Action:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    *   **Example:** A user should only be able to read/write their own profile, and only read/write expenses within groups they are a member of.

2.  **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure all read/write operations are authenticated and authorized.
    *   **Example:**
        ```firestore
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            // Users can only read/write their own profile
            match /users/{userId} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
            }

            // Groups: only members can read/write group data
            match /groups/{groupId} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth.uid != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(groupId)).data.members[request.auth.uid] == true;
              // Note: A more robust member check might involve iterating an array or checking a map
            }

            // Expenses: only members of the group can read/write expenses within that group
            match /expenses/{expenseId} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth.uid != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(request.resource.data.groupId)).data.members[request.auth.uid] == true;
            }

            // ... other collections
          }
        }
        ```

3.  **Validate Data in Rules:**
    *   **Action:** Use security rules to validate incoming data before it's written to Firestore, ensuring it conforms to expected types and constraints.
    *   **Example:** For an expense, ensure `amount` is a number and `description` is a string within a certain length.

    ```firestore
    match /expenses/{expenseId} {
      allow create: if request.auth.uid != null
                    && request.resource.data.amount is number
                    && request.resource.data.amount > 0
                    && request.resource.data.description is string
                    && request.resource.data.description.size() > 0
                    && request.resource.data.description.size() < 100;
      // ... other rules
    }
    ```

4.  **Index Management:**
    *   **Action:** Regularly review and delete unused composite indexes.
    *   **Benefit:** Unused indexes contribute to storage costs and add latency to write operations.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Conduct a thorough review of `firestore.rules`.
2.  Implement rules based on the principle of least privilege.
3.  Add data validation directly within the security rules.
4.  Regularly review and optimize Firestore indexes.
