# Lack of Input Sanitation

## Problem
- **Location**: `firebase/functions/src/expenses/handlers.ts`
- **Description**: The expense handlers do not sanitize user input before storing it in the database. While document handlers already have comprehensive sanitization via `sanitizeDocumentData`, expense handlers only use Joi validation without sanitization. Text fields like `description` and `category` are stored directly without XSS protection.
- **Current vs Expected**: Document handlers have good sanitization, but expense handlers lack it entirely. All user-provided input should be rigorously sanitized before being stored or used in the application.

## Solution
- **Approach**: Add input sanitization to expense handlers using the existing `sanitizeString` function from `utils/security.ts`. The `xss` library is already included and configured. Create a centralized sanitization function for expense data similar to the existing `sanitizeDocumentData`.

## Current State Analysis
- **Document handlers**: Already have comprehensive sanitization via `sanitizeDocumentData`
- **Expense handlers**: Only use Joi validation, no sanitization
- **Security utilities**: Well-implemented with `sanitizeString`, `isDangerousProperty`, and XSS configuration
- **XSS library**: Already installed and configured with strict options

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create expense sanitization function
- Location: `firebase/functions/src/expenses/validation.ts`
- Create `sanitizeExpenseData` function that sanitizes:
  - `description` field (string)
  - `category` field (string) 
  - `receiptUrl` field (string, optional)
- Use existing `sanitizeString` from `utils/security.ts`

### Step 2: Update expense validation functions
- Modify `validateCreateExpense` to call sanitization after Joi validation
- Modify `validateUpdateExpense` to call sanitization after Joi validation
- Ensure sanitization happens before returning validated data

### Step 3: Add unit tests
- Test sanitization of malicious input in expense fields
- Test that legitimate content is preserved
- Test edge cases (empty strings, nulls, etc.)

### Step 4: Integration testing
- Test complete flow from API request to database storage
- Verify no XSS vulnerabilities in stored expense data

## Impact
- **Type**: Behavior change
- **Risk**: Low (existing security utilities are well-tested)
- **Complexity**: Low (leverages existing sanitization infrastructure)
- **Benefit**: High value (improves security and prevents XSS vulnerabilities)

## Implementation Notes
This builds on the existing, well-tested security utilities. The XSS library is already configured with strict options that strip all HTML tags, making it safe for expense data. The implementation should be straightforward since it follows the pattern already used in document handlers.
