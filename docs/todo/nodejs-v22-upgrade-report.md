# Node.js v22 Upgrade Report

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-13)
- Successfully upgraded from Node.js 20 to Node.js 22
- All builds pass without errors
- Tests pass (rate limiting issues in concurrent tests are pre-existing)
- Full project build successful

## Executive Summary

This report outlines the benefits, risks, and procedures for upgrading our Firebase Functions environment to Node.js v22. The primary advantages of upgrading include significant performance enhancements, new built-in features like a stable `fetch` API and WebSocket client, and improved module handling.

However, it is crucial to note that Node.js 22 is currently a "Current" release and will not enter Long-Term Support (LTS) until October 2024. For production environments, LTS versions are generally recommended for their stability and extended support window.

## Key Benefits of Upgrading to Node.js 22

Upgrading to Node.js 22 offers several compelling advantages:

*   **Performance and Efficiency:**
    *   **Faster Execution:** Node.js 22 includes the V8 JavaScript engine version 12.4, which features the Maglev compiler. This can significantly improve the performance of short-lived CLI programs, which is highly relevant for function execution times.
    *   **Improved Memory Management:** The V8 engine's garbage collection has been enhanced, leading to more efficient memory usage.
    *   **Enhanced Stream Performance:** The default `highWaterMark` for streams has been increased from 16KiB to 64KiB, which can boost performance for streaming operations, though it may lead to slightly higher memory consumption.

*   **New Features and Language Enhancements:**
    *   **Stable `fetch` API:** The `fetch` API is now stable, providing a consistent and reliable way to make HTTP requests without external libraries.
    *   **Built-in WebSocket Client:** A native WebSocket client is now included, simplifying the development of real-time applications by removing the need for third-party libraries like `ws`.
    *   **ECMAScript Modules (ESM) Improvements:** Node.js 22 offers better interoperability between ESM and CommonJS modules and introduces an experimental feature to `require()` synchronous ESM graphs.
    *   **Stable Watch Mode:** The `--watch` mode is now stable, allowing for automatic reloading of functions during development without external tools like `nodemon`.

## Potential Risks and Considerations

*   **LTS Status:** Node.js 22 is not yet an LTS release. For production systems, it is often advisable to wait for the LTS version to ensure stability and long-term support.
*   **Firebase Plan:** To use Node.js 22, the Firebase project must be on the Blaze pricing plan.
*   **Migration to 2nd Gen Functions:** For further performance improvements, consider migrating to Cloud Functions for Firebase (2nd gen), which offers better performance, improved concurrency, and more configuration options.

## How to Upgrade in Firebase

To upgrade your Firebase Functions to Node.js 22, you need to:

1.  Ensure your project is on the **Blaze pricing plan**.
2.  Use a recent version of the **Firebase CLI**.
3.  Specify the Node.js version in your `firebase/functions/package.json` file:

    ```json
    "engines": {
      "node": "22"
    }
    ```

## Recommendation

**READY TO IMPLEMENT**: Node.js 22 is now LTS (as of October 2024). The upgrade can proceed safely for both development and production environments.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update Node.js Version ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Updated `firebase/functions/package.json` to specify Node.js 22
2. ✅ Ran build and tests - all TypeScript builds pass
3. ✅ Full project build successful (webapp and functions)

### Phase 2: Future Work (NOT IN THIS TASK)
- Update CI/CD pipelines if needed
- Performance benchmarking
- Leverage new features (fetch API, WebSocket client)
