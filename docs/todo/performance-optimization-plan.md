# Performance Optimization Plan

This document outlines a plan to address key performance issues in the Splitifyd application, focusing on both frontend and backend optimizations.

## 1. Efficient DOM Updates

*   **Problem:** The application frequently re-renders large lists of items (e.g., expenses, groups) from scratch, causing UI jank and slow performance.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Implement Targeted DOM Updates:** Instead of full re-renders, adopt a strategy of making minimal, targeted changes to the DOM. When a single item changes, only the corresponding DOM element should be updated.
    2.  **Use a Keyed-List Strategy:** Assign a unique `data-id` attribute to each element in a list. This allows for efficient finding and updating of specific elements.
    3.  **Develop Granular Rendering Functions:** Create functions like `addListItem`, `updateListItem`, and `removeListItem` to handle individual item changes without affecting the rest of the list.

## 2. Efficient Backend Queries

*   **Problem:** The `listUserExpenses` function is highly inefficient, suffering from the N+1 query problem and performing in-memory pagination.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Denormalize Data for Efficient Queries:** Modify the data model to support more efficient queries. When an expense is created, add a `memberIds` array to the expense document, containing the user IDs of all group members.
    2.  **Use `array-contains` Queries:** Refactor `listUserExpenses` to use a single, efficient Firestore query with an `array-contains` clause on the `memberIds` field. This will allow for scalable, database-level filtering and pagination.

## 3. Distributed Rate Limiting

*   **Problem:** The current in-memory rate limiter is not effective in a distributed serverless environment like Firebase Functions.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Implement a Firestore-Based Rate Limiter:** Replace the in-memory solution with a distributed rate limiter that uses Firestore to store request timestamps. This will ensure that rate limits are enforced correctly across all function instances.
    2.  **Use Firestore Transactions:** Implement the rate-limiting logic within a Firestore transaction to ensure atomic read/write operations, preventing race conditions.

## 4. Lazy Loading and Code Splitting

*   **Problem:** All JavaScript assets are loaded upfront, increasing the initial page load time.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Use Dynamic `import()`:** Refactor the application to use dynamic `import()` statements to load JavaScript modules on demand as they are needed for a specific page or component.
    2.  **Create Page-Specific Entry Points:** Each page should have a minimal initialization script that dynamically loads only the necessary dependencies for that page.

## 5. Debouncing and Throttling

*   **Problem:** Frequent events like search input and window resizing trigger expensive operations on every event, leading to a sluggish UI.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Create `debounce` and `throttle` Utilities:** Add these common utility functions to the codebase.
    2.  **Apply to Event Handlers:** Wrap event handlers for frequent events in `debounce` (for search inputs) or `throttle` (for scrolling/resizing) to limit the rate of execution.
