# Webapp Issue: Expand Component Testing

## Issue Description

Expand component testing to include modal, form validation, list, and navigation components.

## Recommendation

Add tests for modal component (`modal.test.ts`), test form validation components with TypeScript, and add tests for list and navigation components.

## Implementation Suggestions

1.  **Modal Component Testing (`modal.test.ts`):**
    *   Create a new test file `webapp/src/js/components/modal.test.ts`.
    *   Test rendering, showing, hiding, and confirmation dialogs.
    *   Ensure event listeners are correctly attached and removed.

2.  **Form Validation Components Testing:**
    *   Create tests for `FormComponents` in `webapp/src/js/components/form-components.ts`.
    *   Test `formGroup`, `submitButton`, `formActions`, `showError`, `hideError`, `clearAllErrors`, `getFormData`, and `setFormData`.
    *   Focus on how they interact with the DOM and handle various input types and validation states.

3.  **List and Navigation Components Testing:**
    *   Create tests for `ListComponents` in `webapp/src/js/components/list-components.ts`.
    *   Test rendering of group cards, expense items, member items, balance items, empty states, loading states, error states, and pagination controls.
    *   Create tests for `NavigationComponent` in `webapp/src/js/components/navigation.ts` and `NavHeaderComponent` in `webapp/src/js/components/nav-header.ts`.
    *   Test rendering and event listener attachment for navigation elements.

**General Testing Best Practices:**
*   Use a mock DOM environment (like `jsdom` with Jest) for unit testing components.
*   Ensure tests cover different states (e.g., empty data, error states, loading states).
*   Verify correct rendering of HTML structure and content.
*   Test event handling and ensure callbacks are triggered correctly.
