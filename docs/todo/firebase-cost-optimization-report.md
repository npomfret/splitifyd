# Firebase Cost Optimization Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report outlines strategies to manage and minimize Firebase costs as your application, Splitifyd, scales. With a few thousand users and several hundred groups created monthly, proactive cost optimization is crucial. The primary cost drivers will be **Firestore reads/writes**, **Cloud Function invocations**, and **data egress**.

**Key Recommendations:**

*   **Aggressively Cache Data:** Utilize Firestore's offline persistence and set long cache-control headers for static assets in Firebase Hosting.
*   **Optimize Firestore Queries:** Fetch only the data you need using `select` and paginate results. Avoid querying for entire collections.
*   **Denormalize Data:** To reduce expensive read operations, duplicate relevant data across documents. For example, store user display names directly on expense or group documents.
*   **Efficient Cloud Functions:** Configure functions with appropriate memory, manage cold starts, and write idempotent and efficient code.
*   **Set Budgets and Alerts:** This is the most critical step to prevent unexpected costs.

## 2. Firestore Cost Optimization

Firestore costs are driven by document reads, writes, deletes, data storage, and network egress. At your scale, read operations are likely to be the most significant cost factor.

### Data Modeling and Denormalization

*   **Recommendation:** Denormalize data to reduce the need for frequent document reads.
*   **Example:** When displaying a list of expenses, instead of fetching the full user document for each expense to get the user's name, store the user's `displayName` directly on the expense document. This trades a small amount of storage for a significant reduction in read operations.

### Efficient Queries

*   **Recommendation:** Fetch only the data required by the UI.
*   **Action:**
    *   Use the `select` clause in your queries to retrieve only the necessary fields.
    *   Implement pagination for all lists (expenses, groups, etc.) to avoid fetching large collections at once.
    *   Avoid using the `offset` method for pagination, as it still incurs costs for the skipped documents.

### Caching and Offline Persistence

*   **Recommendation:** Enable Firestore's offline persistence in your web application.
*   **Benefit:** This will cache previously fetched data on the client-side, and subsequent requests for the same data will be served from the local cache, resulting in zero read operations. This is highly effective for data that doesn't change frequently.

### Security Rules

*   **Recommendation:** Implement strict Firestore Security Rules.
*   **Benefit:** This is not just for security; it's a cost-control measure that prevents unauthorized or malicious users from running expensive queries that could drive up your bill.

### Index Management

*   **Recommendation:** Regularly review and delete unused composite indexes.
*   **Benefit:** Unused indexes contribute to storage costs and add latency to write operations.

## 3. Cloud Functions Cost Optimization

Cloud Function costs are based on invocation count, compute time, and network egress.

### Configuration

*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Allocate only the necessary memory for your functions. More memory provides more CPU, which can decrease execution time, so test to find the optimal balance.
    *   Deploy functions in the same region as your Firestore database to minimize network latency and data transfer costs.

### Cold Starts

*   **Recommendation:**
    *   For latency-sensitive functions, consider setting a minimum number of instances to keep warm. This will reduce cold starts but incurs a cost for idle instances.
    *   Minimize dependencies in your `package.json` to reduce the cold start time.

### Efficient Code Practices

*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Use Global Variables:** Initialize database connections and other clients in the global scope to reuse them across multiple invocations.
    *   **Idempotency:** Ensure that event-triggered functions can be safely run multiple times with the same input to prevent duplicate work from the built-in retry mechanisms.
    *   **Batch Operations:** For non-time-critical tasks, use scheduled functions to process events in batches rather than invoking a function for every single event.

## 4. Firebase Hosting Cost Optimization

Hosting costs are primarily driven by data transfer (egress).

### CDN and Caching Headers

*   **Recommendation:** Configure `firebase.json` to set long `Cache-Control` `max-age` headers for your static assets (CSS, JS, images).
*   **Benefit:** This instructs browsers and the CDN to cache content for longer, reducing requests to the origin and lowering data transfer costs.

### Asset Optimization

*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Compress images using modern formats like WebP.
    *   Minify your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files.
    *   Use Gzip or Brotli compression to further reduce the size of text-based assets.

## 5. General Recommendations and Monitoring

*   **Emulator Suite:** Use the Firebase Emulator Suite for all local development to avoid incurring any costs during testing.
*   **Budgets and Alerts:** In the Google Cloud Console, set up budgets for your project and configure alerts to be notified when costs approach a certain threshold. This is your most important safety net.
*   **Usage Dashboards:** Regularly check the Firebase console's usage dashboards to understand what is driving your costs. You can't optimize what you can't measure.
