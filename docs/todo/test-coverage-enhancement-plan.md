# Test Coverage Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Firebase functions integration tests, while core functionality is well-tested, there are **critical security vulnerabilities** and significant gaps in edge case coverage that need immediate attention.

## Current Test Coverage Assessment

### ✅ Well-Tested Areas
- User authentication & registration flows
- Group creation and management
- Basic expense CRUD operations
- Share link functionality
- Balance calculations
- Public endpoint security
- Basic XSS and SQL injection prevention

### 🚨 Critical Security Issues Found
1. **Authorization Bypass** (`security.test.ts:154`) - Users can access expenses they're not participants in
2. **Group Membership Manipulation** (`security.test.ts:219`) - Unauthorized group membership updates allowed
3. **DoS Vulnerability** (`security.test.ts:471`) - No payload size limits
4. **Information Disclosure** (`public-endpoints.test.ts:125`) - Config endpoint exposes sensitive data

### ❌ Major Gaps
- Performance and scalability testing
- Advanced security scenarios
- Business logic edge cases
- Error handling and recovery
- Compliance and audit trails

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES (Immediate - Week 1) ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Priority: URGENT** - **Status: IMPLEMENTED**

#### 1.1 Fix Authorization Vulnerabilities ✅
- [x] **API Fix**: Implement proper expense access control in `expenses/handlers.ts`
  - ✅ Enhanced `fetchExpense` function to validate user is participant in expense
  - ✅ Added group owner and admin checks for expense access
  - ✅ Returns 403 Forbidden for non-participants (was bypassing authorization)
- [x] **API Fix**: Add group membership validation in `documents/handlers.ts`
  - ✅ Added validation to prevent direct membership manipulation via updateDocument
  - ✅ Forces use of proper group management endpoints (join/leave)
  - ✅ Blocks unauthorized member additions through document updates
- [x] **Tests**: Add comprehensive authorization test suite
  - ✅ Updated `security.test.ts:154` to verify expense participant validation
  - ✅ Updated `security.test.ts:219` to verify group membership protection
  - ✅ Tests now properly expect 403 errors for unauthorized access

#### 1.2 Address DoS Vulnerabilities ✅
- [x] **API Fix**: Implement request payload size limits
  - ✅ Verified existing Express body size limit (1MB) is working
  - ✅ Confirmed field-specific length limits (200 chars for descriptions)
  - ✅ Updated test to properly validate enormous payload rejection
- [x] **API Fix**: Add rate limiting
  - ✅ Implemented proper IP-based rate limiting in `middleware/validation.ts`
  - ✅ Added configurable limits with 429 status codes and retry headers
  - ✅ Includes automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- [x] **Tests**: Add DoS prevention tests
  - ✅ Fixed enormous payload test to properly validate rejection
  - ✅ Rate limiting tests verify graceful handling of rapid requests

#### 1.3 Fix Information Disclosure ✅
- [x] **API Fix**: Sanitize config endpoint response
  - ✅ Modified `utils/config.ts` to filter out passwords from formDefaults
  - ✅ Removed sensitive data from public config endpoint response
  - ✅ Maintains safe form defaults (displayName, email) while excluding passwords
- [x] **Tests**: Add information disclosure tests
  - ✅ Updated `public-endpoints.test.ts:125` to verify no password exposure
  - ✅ Tests confirm config endpoint no longer exposes sensitive data

**🔒 Security Impact Summary:**
- **Authorization Bypass**: Fixed - Users can only access expenses they participate in
- **Privilege Escalation**: Fixed - Direct group membership manipulation blocked
- **DoS Attacks**: Mitigated - Payload limits and rate limiting implemented
- **Information Disclosure**: Eliminated - Sensitive config data filtered out

### Risk Mitigation
- Phase 1 security fixes are **blocking** for production deployment
- Performance tests should not impact development environment
- All tests must be deterministic and repeatable
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing test infrastructure

### Documentation
- Update test documentation for new scenarios
- Create security testing guidelines
