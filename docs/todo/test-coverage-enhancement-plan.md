# Test Coverage Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Firebase functions integration tests, while core functionality is well-tested, there are **critical security vulnerabilities** and significant gaps in edge case coverage that need immediate attention.

## Current Test Coverage Assessment

### ✅ Well-Tested Areas
- User authentication & registration flows
- Group creation and management
- Basic expense CRUD operations
- Share link functionality
- Balance calculations
- Public endpoint security
- Basic XSS and SQL injection prevention

### 🚨 Critical Security Issues Found
1. **Authorization Bypass** (`security.test.ts:154`) - Users can access expenses they're not participants in
2. **Group Membership Manipulation** (`security.test.ts:219`) - Unauthorized group membership updates allowed
3. **DoS Vulnerability** (`security.test.ts:471`) - No payload size limits
4. **Information Disclosure** (`public-endpoints.test.ts:125`) - Config endpoint exposes sensitive data

### ❌ Major Gaps
- Performance and scalability testing
- Advanced security scenarios
- Business logic edge cases
- Error handling and recovery
- Compliance and audit trails

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES (Immediate - Week 1) ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Priority: URGENT** - **Status: IMPLEMENTED**

#### 1.1 Fix Authorization Vulnerabilities ✅
- [x] **API Fix**: Implement proper expense access control in `expenses/handlers.ts`
  - ✅ Enhanced `fetchExpense` function to validate user is participant in expense
  - ✅ Added group owner and admin checks for expense access
  - ✅ Returns 403 Forbidden for non-participants (was bypassing authorization)
- [x] **API Fix**: Add group membership validation in `documents/handlers.ts`
  - ✅ Added validation to prevent direct membership manipulation via updateDocument
  - ✅ Forces use of proper group management endpoints (join/leave)
  - ✅ Blocks unauthorized member additions through document updates
- [x] **Tests**: Add comprehensive authorization test suite
  - ✅ Updated `security.test.ts:154` to verify expense participant validation
  - ✅ Updated `security.test.ts:219` to verify group membership protection
  - ✅ Tests now properly expect 403 errors for unauthorized access
