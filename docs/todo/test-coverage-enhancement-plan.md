# Test Coverage Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Firebase functions integration tests, while core functionality is well-tested, there are **critical security vulnerabilities** and significant gaps in edge case coverage that need immediate attention.

## Current Test Coverage Assessment

### ‚úÖ Well-Tested Areas
- User authentication & registration flows
- Group creation and management
- Basic expense CRUD operations
- Share link functionality
- Balance calculations
- Public endpoint security
- Basic XSS and SQL injection prevention

### üö® Critical Security Issues Found
1. **Authorization Bypass** (`security.test.ts:154`) - Users can access expenses they're not participants in
2. **Group Membership Manipulation** (`security.test.ts:219`) - Unauthorized group membership updates allowed
3. **DoS Vulnerability** (`security.test.ts:471`) - No payload size limits
4. **Information Disclosure** (`public-endpoints.test.ts:125`) - Config endpoint exposes sensitive data

### ‚ùå Major Gaps
- Performance and scalability testing
- Advanced security scenarios
- Business logic edge cases
- Error handling and recovery
- Compliance and audit trails

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES (Immediate - Week 1)

**Priority: URGENT**

#### 1.1 Fix Authorization Vulnerabilities
- [ ] **API Fix**: Implement proper expense access control in `expenses/handlers.ts`
  - Only allow participants or group admins to access expenses
  - Return 403 (not 404) for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] **API Fix**: Add group membership validation in `documents/handlers.ts`
  - Prevent unauthorized member additions via updateDocument
  - Validate all membership changes through proper endpoints only
- [ ] **Tests**: Add comprehensive authorization test suite
  - Test cross-user data access prevention
  - Test privilege escalation attempts
  - Test proper error codes for unauthorized access

#### 1.2 Address DoS Vulnerabilities
- [ ] **API Fix**: Implement request payload size limits
  - Add Express middleware for body size limits (1MB max)
  - Implement field-specific length limits (descriptions, names)
- [ ] **API Fix**: Add rate limiting
  - Implement per-user rate limiting (100 requests/hour)
  - Add endpoint-specific limits (10 expenses/minute)
- [ ] **Tests**: Add DoS prevention tests
  - Test enormous payload rejection
  - Test rate limiting enforcement

#### 1.3 Fix Information Disclosure
- [ ] **API Fix**: Sanitize config endpoint response
  - Remove sensitive configuration from public config
  - Add environment-specific config filtering
- [ ] **Tests**: Add information disclosure tests
  - Verify no sensitive data in error messages
  - Test config endpoint security

### Phase 2: MISSING CORE FUNCTIONALITY (Week 2-3)

**Priority: HIGH**

#### 2.1 Business Logic Edge Cases
- [ ] **Tests**: Split validation
  - Test splits that don't add up to total amount
  - Test negative split amounts
  - Test decimal precision in calculations
- [ ] **Tests**: Group size limits
  - Test groups with 50+ members
  - Test performance with large groups
  - Test UI limits vs API limits
- [ ] **Tests**: Monetary edge cases
  - Test very large amounts (millions)
  - Test very small amounts (cents)
  - Test currency formatting validation
- [ ] **Tests**: Group lifecycle
  - Test group deletion with existing expenses
  - Test user leaving group with outstanding balances
  - Test orphaned expense handling

#### 2.2 Enhanced Data Validation
- [ ] **Tests**: Date validation
  - Test future expense dates
  - Test very old expense dates
  - Test invalid date formats
- [ ] **Tests**: Category validation
  - Test invalid expense categories
  - Test category enumeration enforcement
- [ ] **Tests**: User input limits
  - Test maximum description lengths
  - Test special characters in names
  - Test Unicode handling

#### 2.3 Concurrent Operations
- [ ] **Tests**: Race conditions
  - Test concurrent expense creation in same group
  - Test concurrent balance updates
  - Test concurrent group membership changes
- [ ] **Tests**: Transaction integrity
  - Test partial transaction failures
  - Test database consistency after errors

### Phase 3: PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY (Week 4)

**Priority: MEDIUM**

#### 3.1 Load Testing
- [ ] **Tests**: Concurrent user operations
  - Test 10+ users creating expenses simultaneously
  - Test database connection pooling under load
  - Test memory usage during concurrent operations
- [ ] **Tests**: Response time benchmarks
  - Set target response times (< 500ms for reads, < 2s for writes)
  - Test performance degradation with large datasets
  - Test pagination performance with large expense lists

#### 3.2 Scalability Testing
- [ ] **Tests**: Large dataset handling
  - Test groups with 1000+ expenses
  - Test users with 100+ group memberships
  - Test balance calculation performance with complex debt graphs

### Phase 4: ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY (Week 5)

**Priority: MEDIUM**

#### 4.1 Service Outage Scenarios
- [ ] **Tests**: External service failures
  - Test Firebase Auth service outages
  - Test Firestore connection failures
  - Test partial service degradation
- [ ] **Tests**: Network issues
  - Test request timeout handling
  - Test connection retry logic
  - Test graceful degradation

#### 4.2 Data Integrity
- [ ] **Tests**: Backup and recovery
  - Test data export functionality
  - Test data restoration procedures
  - Test orphaned data cleanup

### Phase 5: COMPLIANCE & AUDIT (Week 6)

**Priority: LOW**

#### 5.1 Audit Trails
- [ ] **Tests**: Expense modification history
  - Test audit log creation for all changes
  - Test audit log immutability
  - Test audit log querying
- [ ] **Tests**: User activity tracking
  - Test login/logout logging
  - Test sensitive operation logging

#### 5.2 Data Privacy Compliance
- [ ] **Tests**: GDPR compliance
  - Test user data export
  - Test user data deletion
  - Test consent management
- [ ] **Tests**: Data retention
  - Test automatic data purging
  - Test data anonymization

## Success Metrics

### Security Metrics
- [ ] Zero authorization bypass vulnerabilities
- [ ] All DoS vectors protected
- [ ] No sensitive data exposure in responses
- [ ] 100% test coverage for security scenarios

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] API response times < 500ms for reads, < 2s for writes
- [ ] Support for 100+ concurrent users
- [ ] Memory usage < 512MB under normal load
- [ ] Zero data corruption under concurrent operations

### Coverage Metrics
- [ ] 95%+ code coverage for all endpoints
- [ ] 100% coverage of error paths
- [ ] All edge cases documented and tested

## Implementation Notes

### Testing Strategy
- Use existing `ApiDriver` for consistency
- Maintain isolation between test suites
- Use Firebase emulator for realistic testing
- Add performance monitoring to existing tests

### Risk Mitigation
- Phase 1 security fixes are **blocking** for production deployment
- Performance tests should not impact development environment
- All tests must be deterministic and repeatable
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing test infrastructure

### Documentation
- Update test documentation for new scenarios
- Create security testing guidelines
- Document performance benchmarks and targets
- Maintain test data setup/teardown procedures

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Priority | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Week 1 | URGENT | Security fixes + tests |
| 2 | Week 2-3 | HIGH | Core functionality gaps |
| 3 | Week 4 | MEDIUM | Performance testing |
| 4 | Week 5 | MEDIUM | Error handling |
| 5 | Week 6 | LOW | Compliance testing |

**Total Effort**: 6 weeks
**Critical Path**: Phase 1 security fixes must be completed before production deployment
