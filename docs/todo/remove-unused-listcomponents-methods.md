# Remove Unused Methods in ListComponents

## Issue
Several static methods are defined in ListComponents but never used anywhere in the codebase.

## Unused Methods
- `renderPaginationControls()` (line 131)
- `attachPaginationListeners()` (line 151)
- `renderLoadingState()` (line 112)
- `renderErrorState()` (line 121)
- `renderEmptyState()` (line 99)

## Location
`/webapp/src/js/components/list-components.ts`

## Action Required
Either:
1. Remove these unused methods entirely, OR
2. Implement their usage if they were intended to be used

## Recommendation
Remove them unless there's a clear plan to use them soon. Dead code adds maintenance burden without value.

## Implementation Plan

### Analysis Complete âœ“
- Verified all 5 methods exist in the file at the specified lines
- Confirmed none of these methods are used anywhere in the codebase
- The methods appear to be intended for future functionality that was never implemented
- No existing code depends on these methods

### Approach
**Decision**: Remove all 5 unused methods
- Aligns with project principle of "aggressively tidy, delete, refactor the code"
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Removes ~65 lines of dead code
- No risk since methods are completely unused

### Implementation Steps
1. **Remove the methods** (single atomic change):
   - Delete `renderEmptyState()` (lines 99-110)
   - Delete `renderLoadingState()` (lines 112-119)
   - Delete `renderErrorState()` (lines 121-129)
   - Delete `renderPaginationControls()` (lines 131-149)
   - Delete `attachPaginationListeners()` (lines 151-163)

2. **Verify the changes**:
   - Run `npm run build` in webapp directory
   - Run `npm test` to ensure no tests break
   - Confirm TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors

### Notes
- These methods provide UI state rendering (loading, error, empty states) and pagination controls
- If these features are needed in the future, they should be implemented as proper components following the existing component architecture pattern (like WarningBannerComponent, ButtonComponent, etc.)
- The current static utility approach doesn't align with the component-based architecture used elsewhere
