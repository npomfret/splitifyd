# Webapp Issue: Develop a Reusable Component Library

## Issue Description

Common UI elements are re-implemented in multiple places, leading to code duplication and visual inconsistencies.

## Recommendation

Identify and abstract reusable components, and establish a clear component API.

## Implementation Suggestions

1.  **Identify and Abstract Reusable Components:**
    *   **Action:** Go through the existing codebase and identify UI patterns that appear repeatedly. These are candidates for reusable components.
    *   **Examples (already existing or to be expanded):
        *   `AuthCardComponent` (`webapp/src/js/components/auth-card.ts`)
        *   `FormComponents` (`webapp/src/js/components/form-components.ts`)
        *   `HeaderComponent` (`webapp/src/js/components/header.ts`)
        *   `ListComponents` (`webapp/src/js/components/list-components.ts`)
        *   `ModalComponent` (`webapp/src/js/components/modal.ts`)
        *   `NavHeaderComponent` (`webapp/src/js/components/nav-header.ts`)
        *   `NavigationComponent` (`webapp/src/js/components/navigation.ts`)
    *   **New Candidates:** Buttons (with different styles/icons), input fields (with validation feedback), loading spinners, empty states, error messages, member avatars, etc.

2.  **Establish a Clear Component API:**
    *   **Action:** Each component should have a well-defined interface for passing in data and handling events, making them easy to use and compose.
    *   **Approach:**
        *   Use TypeScript interfaces to define the `props` or `config` object that each component expects.
        *   Ensure components are self-contained and manage their own DOM elements and event listeners (as per `webapp-consistent-component-pattern.md`).
        *   Provide clear methods for rendering (`render()`) and cleaning up (`cleanup()`).

**Next Steps:**
1.  Conduct a comprehensive audit of the UI to identify all potential reusable components.
2.  For each identified component, define its API (TypeScript interface for props).
3.  Implement new components or refactor existing ones to adhere to the consistent component pattern and API.
4.  Replace duplicated UI code with instances of the new reusable components.
