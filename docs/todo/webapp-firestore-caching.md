# Webapp Issue: Firestore Caching and Offline Persistence

## Issue Description

Firestore read operations are a significant cost factor. Enabling Firestore's offline persistence in the web application can reduce these costs.

## Recommendation

Enable Firestore's offline persistence in your web application. This will cache previously fetched data on the client-side, and subsequent requests for the same data will be served from the local cache, resulting in zero read operations. This is highly effective for data that doesn't change frequently.

## Implementation Suggestions

1.  **Initialize Firestore with Offline Persistence:**
    *   In your Firebase initialization code (e.g., `webapp/src/js/firebase-config.ts` or a dedicated Firestore initialization file), enable offline persistence.

    ```typescript
    // webapp/src/js/firebase-config.ts (or similar)
    import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
    import { getFirestore, enableIndexedDbPersistence } from 'firebase/firestore';

    // ... (inside your Firebase initialization logic)

    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    const db = getFirestore(app);

    try {
      await enableIndexedDbPersistence(db);
      console.log('Offline persistence enabled');
    } catch (err) {
      if (err.code === 'failed-precondition') {
        // Multiple tabs open, persistence can only be enabled in one tab at a time.
        // Handle this case, perhaps by informing the user.
        console.warn('Offline persistence failed: Multiple tabs open', err);
      } else if (err.code === 'unimplemented') {
        // The current browser does not support all of the
        // features required to enable persistence.
        console.warn('Offline persistence failed: Browser not supported', err);
      } else {
        console.error('Error enabling offline persistence', err);
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Consider Data Freshness:**
    *   While offline persistence is great for cost, be mindful of data freshness. For data that needs to be absolutely up-to-the-minute, ensure you are using real-time listeners or explicitly fetching fresh data when necessary.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Add the `enableIndexedDbPersistence` call to your Firebase Firestore initialization.
2.  Test the application with and without network connectivity to verify offline functionality.
