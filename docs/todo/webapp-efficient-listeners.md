# Implement Efficient Real-time Listeners

## Task

Review and refactor all Firestore listeners in the webapp to ensure they are as efficient as possible. This involves limiting the scope of listeners to only the data that is strictly necessary for the user interface.

## Background

Currently, some listeners in the webapp might be attached to entire collections, which is inefficient for large datasets. This can lead to increased read costs and slower performance as the application scales.

## Implementation Strategy

1.  **Identify all Firestore listeners** in the webapp codebase.
2.  **Analyze the data requirements** for each view where a listener is used.
3.  **Refactor listeners to use queries** with `where()` clauses to filter the data server-side. For example, instead of listening to the entire `messages` collection, listen only to new messages:

    ```javascript
    import { collection, query, where, onSnapshot } from "firebase/firestore";

    const q = query(collection(db, "messages"), where("timestamp", ">", new Date()));

    const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(q, (querySnapshot) => {
      querySnapshot.docChanges().forEach((change) => {
        if (change.type === "added") {
          console.log("New message: ", change.doc.data());
        }
      });
    });
    ```
4.  **Manage listener lifecycle**: Ensure that listeners are detached when they are no longer needed (e.g., when the user navigates away from a view) to prevent memory leaks and unnecessary costs.
5.  **Monitor listener performance** using the Firebase console to ensure that the changes have had a positive impact.
