# Outdated Dependencies

## Problem
- **Location**: `package.json`, `firebase/functions/package.json`, `webapp/package.json`
- **Description**: The project's `package.json` files may contain outdated dependencies. Using outdated dependencies can expose the application to security vulnerabilities and prevent it from benefiting from the latest features and performance improvements.
- **Current vs Expected**: Currently, the dependencies may be several versions behind the latest releases. They should be updated to the latest stable versions.

## Solution
- **Approach**: Use a tool like `npm-check-updates` to identify and update the outdated dependencies in all `package.json` files. After updating, run all tests to ensure that the new versions have not introduced any breaking changes.
- **Code Sample**:
  ```bash
  npx npm-check-updates -u
  npm install
  ```
  This command should be run in the root directory, as well as in the `firebase/functions` and `webapp` directories.

## Impact
- **Type**: Behavior change (dependency updates can introduce breaking changes)
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Complexity**: Moderate
- **Benefit**: High value (improves security and keeps the project up-to-date)

## Implementation Notes
It's important to carefully review the release notes for any major version updates to understand the potential impact on the codebase. After updating, a thorough testing cycle is necessary to catch any regressions.
