# Report: Improving Client-Server Data Integrity

## 1. Problem

Our client-side JavaScript code is fragile and frequently breaks due to unexpected changes in the shape of JSON objects returned from the server. These bugs are hard to catch because we lack in-browser testing, leading to a poor user experience and time-consuming debugging sessions.

The root cause is the absence of a data contract between the frontend and the backend. The client-side code makes assumptions about the structure of the data, and when the backend changes, these assumptions are violated.

## 2. Goal

To reduce the occurrence of these bugs by establishing a clearer contract for data exchanged between the client and server, without implementing a full in-browser testing suite at this stage.

## 3. Proposed Solutions

Here are a few options, ranging from simple to more involved, that can help solve this problem.

### Option 1: Shared TypeScript Types (Recommended)

**Concept:** Since the Firebase backend is written in TypeScript, we can define the data structures (interfaces or types) for our API responses in a shared location. Both the backend and the frontend can then reference this single source of truth.

**Implementation:**

1.  **Create a shared directory:** We can create a new directory, for example, `packages/shared-types`, that is accessible to both the `firebase` and `webapp` projects.
2.  **Define Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** In this shared directory, we would define the TypeScript interfaces for all our API payloads. For example, a `Group` type would look the same for the client and the server.
3.  **Backend Refactoring:** The backend functions would be updated to import and use these shared types in their function signatures and return types.
4.  **Frontend Adoption:** The frontend, while still being JavaScript, can leverage these types using JSDoc annotations. With a `jsconfig.json` file in the `webapp` directory, modern code editors like VS Code can provide type-checking and IntelliSense, alerting developers when they are accessing properties that don't exist.

**Pros:**

*   **Single Source of Truth:** Eliminates drift between client and server data models.
*   **Early Error Detection:** Catches many potential bugs during development (in the IDE) rather than in production.
*   **Improved Developer Experience:** Better autocompletion and code navigation.
*   **Foundation for TypeScript:** Paves the way for a potential future migration of the client-side code to TypeScript.

**Cons:**

*   Requires some initial setup and refactoring.

### Option 2: Client-Side Runtime Validation

**Concept:** Before the client-side code uses an object from the API, it first validates it against a predefined schema. If the object doesn't match the schema, the application can handle the error gracefully instead of crashing.

**Implementation:**

*   We could use a lightweight validation library like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) or [Joi](https://joi.dev/).
*   For each API endpoint, we would define a schema on the client side.
*   The API fetching logic would be wrapped in a validation function.

**Pros:**

*   **Robust Runtime Safety:** Catches all data shape errors, even those that static analysis might miss.
*   **Clear Error Handling:** Provides a clear path for dealing with unexpected API responses.

**Cons:**

*   **Schema Drift:** The validation schemas on the client can become out-of-sync with the backend types if not managed carefully.
*   **Boilerplate:** Adds some repetitive code to the client.
*   **Runtime Overhead:** A minor performance cost for validation.

### Option 3: Combining Shared Types and Runtime Validation (Best of Both Worlds)

This is an extension of Option 1. We can use our shared TypeScript types to *automatically generate* the Zod schemas for runtime validation. Libraries like `ts-to-zod` can do this.

This approach gives us the development-time benefits of shared types and the runtime safety of validation, without the need to maintain schemas manually.

## 4. Recommendation

I recommend we adopt **Option 1 (Shared TypeScript Types)** as a starting point.

It provides the most significant benefit for the least amount of disruption. It directly addresses the root problem by creating a single source of truth and enhances the developer experience immediately. It also lays the perfect foundation for migrating to a more robust solution like **Option 3** in the future.

## 5. Next Steps

1.  Create a `packages/shared-types` directory.
2.  Define a TypeScript interface for a single, core data model (e.g., `Group` or `Expense`) as a proof-of-concept.
3.  Refactor the relevant Firebase Function to use this shared type.
4.  Set up a `jsconfig.json` in the `webapp` project and update a piece of client-side code to use the shared type via JSDoc comments.
5.  Verify that type-checking and autocompletion are working in the IDE for the client-side code.
