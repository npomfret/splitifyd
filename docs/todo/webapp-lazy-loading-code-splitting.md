# Webapp Issue: Lazy Loading and Code Splitting

## Issue Description

All JavaScript assets are loaded upfront, increasing the initial page load time.

## Recommendation

Refactor the application to use dynamic `import()` statements to load JavaScript modules on demand as they are needed for a specific page or component. Create page-specific entry points where each page has a minimal initialization script that dynamically loads only the necessary dependencies for that page.

## Implementation Suggestions

1.  **Identify Modules for Lazy Loading:**
    *   Modules that are only needed on specific pages (e.g., `add-expense.ts` is only needed on the add expense page).
    *   Modules that are large or contain complex logic that isn't immediately required on page load.

2.  **Use Dynamic `import()`:**
    *   Replace static `import` statements with dynamic `import()` where appropriate.
    *   **Example:** Instead of `import { GroupsList } from './groups.js';` at the top of `dashboard-init.ts` (or `dashboard.ts` after consolidation), you would load it dynamically.

    ```typescript
    // webapp/src/js/dashboard.ts (after consolidation)

    async function initializeDashboardPage(): Promise<void> {
        // ... (initial setup)

        // Dynamically import GroupsList when needed
        const { GroupsList } = await import('./groups.js');
        const groupsList = new GroupsList('groupsContainer');
        groupsList.loadGroups();

        // ...
    }
    ```

3.  **Create Page-Specific Entry Points:**
    *   Ensure each HTML page loads only a minimal JavaScript file that acts as its entry point.
    *   This entry point then dynamically imports other modules as needed.
    *   **Example:** `index.html` loads `auth-redirect.ts`, `dashboard.html` loads `dashboard.ts`, `add-expense.html` loads `add-expense.ts`, etc.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ Audit all HTML files and their JavaScript entry points
2. ‚úÖ Identify modules that can be loaded dynamically  
3. ‚úÖ Plan implementation approach for dashboard.ts first

### Phase 2: Implementation (IN PROGRESS)
1. üîÑ Refactor dashboard.ts to use dynamic imports for GroupsList
2. ‚è≥ Update other page entry points to use dynamic imports
3. ‚è≥ Test that all functionality works correctly

### Phase 3: Performance Testing
1. ‚è≥ Measure page load times before and after implementing lazy loading
2. ‚è≥ Quantify the performance improvement

### Files to Modify:
- `webapp/src/js/dashboard.ts` - Convert GroupsList import to dynamic
- Other entry point files as identified in audit

### Current Static Imports Identified:
- `dashboard.ts` ‚Üí `GroupsList` (main candidate for lazy loading)
- Other modules are mostly utilities needed at initialization

**Next Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Audit all HTML files and their corresponding JavaScript entry points.
2. ‚úÖ Identify modules that can be loaded dynamically.
3. üîÑ Refactor `import` statements to use dynamic `import()` where appropriate.
4. ‚è≥ Measure page load times before and after implementing lazy loading to quantify the performance improvement.
