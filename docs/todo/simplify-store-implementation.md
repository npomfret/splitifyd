# Simplify Store Implementation

## Issue
The store implementation uses a Proxy-based approach that appears over-engineered for current needs.

## Problems
1. Complex Proxy-based reactivity system
2. `clearSubscribers()` method is exported but never used
3. May be adding unnecessary complexity

## Location
`/webapp/src/js/store.ts`

## Action Required
1. Evaluate if the Proxy pattern is providing value
2. Remove the unused `clearSubscribers()` export
3. Consider simplifying to a more straightforward state management approach
4. Document why this complexity is needed if keeping it

## Questions to Consider
- Is reactive state management actually being used?
- Are subscriptions being used effectively?
- Could a simpler object-based store suffice?
