# Simplify Store Implementation

## Issue
The store implementation uses a Proxy-based approach that appears over-engineered for current needs.

## Problems
1. Complex Proxy-based reactivity system
2. `clearSubscribers()` method is exported but never used
3. May be adding unnecessary complexity

## Location
`/webapp/src/js/store.ts`

## Analysis Results
**CRITICAL FINDING**: The store system is completely unused in the actual application!

- Store is only used in test files (`store.test.ts`)
- Application uses direct localStorage access and `authManager` instead
- No HTML files or JavaScript modules reference the store
- Proxy-based reactivity and subscriptions are not being utilized

## Decision: DELETE THE STORE
Since the store is entirely unused, the most appropriate action is to remove it completely rather than simplify it.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Remove Store Files
- Delete `/webapp/src/js/store.ts`
- Delete `/webapp/src/js/store.test.ts`

### Step 2: Verify No Dependencies
- Confirm no imports of store functionality exist
- Ensure no other files reference store exports

### Step 3: Test Application
- Run tests to ensure no regressions
- Verify application still functions correctly

## Rationale
- Follows "delete pointless/outdated code" principle from common-mistakes.md
- Removes unused complexity
- Aligns with "prefer simple solutions" architecture rule
- No risk since it's not used anywhere

## Impact
- **Type**: Pure deletion of unused code
- **Risk**: None (unused code)
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Benefit**: Reduced codebase size and complexity
