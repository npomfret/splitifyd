# Webapp Issue: Remove Duplicated Code

## Issue Description

The same logic for authentication checks, error display, and form validation is repeated in many files.

## Recommendation

Abstract all duplicated logic into common utility functions.

## Implementation Suggestions

Create utility modules like `authUtils.js`, `uiUtils.js`, and `validation.js` to house shared logic.

### Specific Duplications Identified (and already addressed in separate issues):

*   **Authentication Checks (`waitForAuthManager`):** Covered in `docs/todo/issues/webapp-redundant-waitforauthmanager.md`.
*   **Error/UI Message Display (`showMessage`, `showError`, etc.):** Covered in `docs/todo/issues/webapp-redundant-ui-messages.md`.
*   **Direct `localStorage.getItem('userId')` Access:** Covered in `docs/todo/issues/webapp-direct-localstorage-access.md`.

### Progress: Form Validation Refactoring

- **Status:** Completed
- **Description:** Abstracted common form validation logic (e.g., email validation, required field checks) into a new utility module: `webapp/src/js/utils/form-validation.ts`.
- **Impacted Files:** `webapp/src/js/add-expense.ts` and `webapp/src/js/reset-password.ts` were updated to utilize the new validation functions.
- **Verification:** Webapp build and tests passed successfully after the changes.

### Further Action:

Review the codebase for any other instances of duplicated logic, especially in form validation and common UI patterns, and extract them into appropriate utility modules.
