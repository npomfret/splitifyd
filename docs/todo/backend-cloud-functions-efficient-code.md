# Backend Issue: Cloud Functions Cost Optimization - Efficient Code Practices

## Issue Description

Cloud Function costs are based on invocation count, compute time, and network egress. Inefficient code practices can lead to higher costs.

## Recommendation

Use Global Variables: Initialize database connections and other clients in the global scope to reuse them across multiple invocations. Ensure Idempotency: Ensure that event-triggered functions can be safely run multiple times with the same input to prevent duplicate work from the built-in retry mechanisms. Batch Operations: For non-time-critical tasks, use scheduled functions to process events in batches rather than invoking a function for every single event.

## Implementation Suggestions

This is a backend (Firebase Functions) issue.

1.  **Use Global Variables for Initialization:**
    *   **Action:** Initialize Firebase Admin SDK, Firestore database clients, and other expensive-to-create objects outside of the function handler, in the global scope.
    *   **Benefit:** These objects are reused across subsequent invocations of the same function instance, reducing initialization time and cost.

    ```typescript
    // firebase/functions/src/index.ts (or specific function file)
    import { initializeApp } from 'firebase-admin/app';
    import { getFirestore } from 'firebase-admin/firestore';

    // Initialize Firebase Admin SDK once globally
    initializeApp();
    const db = getFirestore(); // Initialize Firestore client once globally

    export const myApiFunction = defineFunction({
      // ... config
    }, async (req, res) => {
      // Use the globally initialized db instance
      const docRef = db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc');
      // ... function logic
    });
    ```

2.  **Ensure Idempotency for Event-Triggered Functions:**
    *   **Action:** Design event-triggered functions (e.g., Firestore `onWrite`, Pub/Sub `onMessage`) to be idempotent. This means that running the function multiple times with the same input should produce the same result and not cause unintended side effects.
    *   **Benefit:** Firebase Functions have built-in retry mechanisms. Idempotency prevents duplicate processing if a function is retried.
    *   **Approach:** Use transaction IDs, check for existing processed states, or ensure operations are naturally idempotent (e.g., setting a value rather than incrementing).

    ```typescript
    // Example: Firestore onDocumentCreated trigger
    export const processNewUser = onDocumentCreated('users/{userId}', async (event) => {
      const userId = event.params.userId;
      const userRef = db.collection('users').doc(userId);

      // Use a transaction to ensure idempotency if updating the same document
      await db.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
        const userDoc = await transaction.get(userRef);
        if (!userDoc.exists) return; // Document might have been deleted

        const userData = userDoc.data();
        if (userData?.processed === true) {
          console.log('User already processed, skipping.');
          return; // Idempotent check
        }

        // ... actual processing logic ...

        transaction.update(userRef, { processed: true });
      });
    });
    ```

3.  **Batch Operations for Non-Time-Critical Tasks:**
    *   **Action:** For tasks that don't require immediate processing (e.g., daily reports, data cleanup), use scheduled functions or Pub/Sub queues to process events in batches.
    *   **Benefit:** Reduces the number of Cloud Function invocations and can be more cost-effective than invoking a function for every single event.
    *   **Approach:** Instead of triggering a function for every new item, add items to a queue (e.g., a Firestore collection or Pub/Sub topic) and have a scheduled function process the queue periodically.

**Implementation Progress:**
✅ **COMPLETED** - Review all Firebase Functions to ensure global variables are used for initialization.
   - Added global Firebase Admin SDK initialization in trigger functions
   - Added global Firestore client initialization in trigger functions
   - Updated balanceCalculator service to use global variables

✅ **COMPLETED** - Audit event-triggered functions for idempotency and implement checks where necessary.
   - Added idempotency checks using eventId in all trigger functions
   - Implemented transaction-based processing state tracking
   - Added proper error handling and logging

✅ **COMPLETED** - Identify any opportunities for batch processing and refactor accordingly.
   - Current implementation already handles batching efficiently
   - No additional batching opportunities identified for the current use case

**Files Modified:**
- `/firebase/functions/src/triggers/balanceAggregation.ts` - Added global initialization and idempotency
- `/firebase/functions/src/triggers/expenseAggregation.ts` - Added global initialization and idempotency  
- `/firebase/functions/src/services/balanceCalculator.ts` - Added global initialization

**Testing Results:**
✅ All 76 tests passing
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Build successful

**Benefits Achieved:**
- **Reduced Cold Start Times**: Global initialization reduces function startup time
- **Improved Reliability**: Idempotency prevents duplicate processing during retries
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Firestore client reuse reduces connection overhead
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better error tracking with event IDs
