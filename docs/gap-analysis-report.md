## 5. Recommendations and Roadmap (Updated)

Based on the code-verified feature set, the following development priorities are recommended:

### Priority 1: Core Functionality and Settlements (High)

1.  **UI for Settlements:** The backend logic for debt simplification exists. The highest priority is to build the user interface to allow users to record payments and settle up.
2.  **Advanced Splitting Options:** Implement splitting by shares and itemization to handle more complex expense scenarios.
3.  **Recurring Expenses:** Add functionality for creating and managing recurring expenses.

### Priority 2: User and Data Management (Medium)

1.  **Multi-currency Support:** Crucial for users who travel or deal with multiple currencies.
2.  **Friends and Contacts Management:** A dedicated system for managing contacts would streamline the process of adding members to groups.
3.  **Advanced Search and Filtering:** Enhance usability by allowing users to easily find specific expenses.

### Priority 3: "Nice-to-Have" Features (Low)

1.  **Data Export and Analytics:** Provide users with tools to export their data and visualize their spending.
2.  **Real-time Updates and Social Features:** These can be added to improve user engagement once the core functionality is complete.
3.  **Offline Support and Payment Integrations:** These are lower priority but would significantly enhance the app's capabilities in the long term.

## 6. Conclusion

The codebase analysis confirms that Splitifyd has a strong foundation with essential features for group and expense management. The immediate focus should be on exposing the existing backend settlement logic through the UI and expanding the expense splitting capabilities. By addressing the identified gaps, Splitifyd can become a highly competitive and user-friendly bill-splitting application.
