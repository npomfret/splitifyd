# Edit Expense

**Status:** Not Implemented

## Description
This feature will allow users to edit an existing expense, provided they have the necessary permissions (e.g., they created the expense).

## Missing Items
- A dedicated "Edit Expense" form, pre-filled with the existing expense data.
- The ability to change the amount, description, date, payer, split type, participants, and category.
- Validation to ensure the edited data is consistent (e.g., new split amounts still add up to the total).
- An activity log or history to track changes to an expense.
- Real-time updates to all participants in the expense when it is edited.
