Mental change: I'm a lot less precious about having it change code that it created than I would be about code that I created

Security blunders
* Putting passwords into source files.  
* Not spotting it even with a hint.
* Breaking the app (losing the data) when i told it to fix the explicite problem

Common code blunders
* making code that does not compile and not bothing to run any sort of build unless told to in CLAUDE.md
* it would make changes that are perhaps common practice in the industry that i do not like and have told it not to do
