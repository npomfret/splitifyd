## Summary

This policy explains how our service ("we," "us," "our") uses cookies and similar technologies.

*   **What we use:** We only use cookies that are essential for the Service to work correctly and securely. For example, we use cookies to keep you logged in.
*   **What we DON'T use:** We **do not** currently use cookies for analytics, advertising, or other non-essential tracking.
*   **Future Changes:** If we decide to use non-essential cookies in the future (like for analytics), we will ask for your explicit consent through a cookie banner before we do so.

## 1. What are Cookies?

A "cookie" is a small text file that a website stores on your computer or mobile device when you visit. Cookies enable websites to remember your actions and preferences (such as login status, language, or display preferences) over time, so you don't have to re-enter them each time you visit or navigate between pages.

Similar technologies include:

*   **Local Storage:** Data stored in your browser that persists until cleared
*   **Session Storage:** Data stored in your browser that is cleared when you close the tab
*   **Pixels/Web Beacons:** Small images that can track when content is viewed (we do not currently use these)

## 2. How We Use Cookies

We use cookies for a limited number of **essential purposes only**. We believe in data minimization and only use cookies that are strictly necessary to provide our Service.

### 2.1. Strictly Necessary Cookies

These cookies are essential for you to browse the Service and use its features. Without these cookies, the Service cannot function properly. **You cannot opt out of these cookies** as they are fundamental to the Service's operation.

| Cookie Type | Purpose | Duration |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Authentication Cookies** | To verify your identity and maintain your login session as you navigate through the app | Session / Persistent |
| **Security Cookies** | To help identify and prevent security risks, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks | Session |
| **Preference Cookies** | To remember your settings and preferences within the Service | Persistent |

### 2.2. Firebase Authentication

We use Google Firebase for authentication, which sets cookies to manage your login session securely. These cookies are essential for the Service to function and cannot be disabled.

## 3. What We Do NOT Use

Our service **does not** currently use cookies or other tracking technologies for:

*   **Analytics:** We do not use Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or similar services to track your behavior
*   **Advertising:** We do not use advertising cookies, remarketing pixels, or ad networks
*   **Social Media:** We do not embed social media tracking widgets
*   **Third-Party Tracking:** We do not allow third parties to place tracking cookies through our Service

**If we introduce non-essential cookies in the future**, we will:

1.  Update this Cookie Policy
2.  Provide you with clear notice
3.  Implement a cookie consent manager
4.  Obtain your affirmative consent before placing non-essential cookies on your device

## 4. Your Choices and How to Manage Cookies

### 4.1. Browser Controls

You can control and manage cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to:

*   View what cookies are stored and delete them individually
*   Block third-party cookies
*   Block cookies from specific sites
*   Block all cookies
*   Delete all cookies when you close your browser

Please note that if you block or delete strictly necessary cookies, the Service may not function correctly—you may not be to log in or access certain features.

### 4.2. How to Manage Cookies in Common Browsers

*   **Chrome:** Settings → Privacy and Security → Cookies and other site data
*   **Firefox:** Settings → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data
*   **Safari:** Preferences → Privacy → Cookies and website data
*   **Edge:** Settings → Cookies and site permissions → Cookies and site data

### 4.3. Current Status

Since we only use strictly necessary cookies, there is no need for a cookie preferences panel or consent banner at this time. Browser-level controls are the only mechanism available for managing cookies.

---

## 5. Do Not Track Signals

Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature. Because there is no industry consensus on how to respond to DNT signals, and because we do not currently use tracking cookies, our Service does not specifically respond to DNT signals.

---

## 6. Updates to This Cookie Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time, particularly if we decide to introduce new types of cookies or tracking technologies. When we make changes:

*   We will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy
*   For significant changes (such as introducing analytics or advertising cookies), we will provide more prominent notice and obtain consent where required

We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
