    // All UserPolicyService methods require Firebase and should be tested
    // in integration tests with the emulator running:
    //
    // - acceptPolicy() - requires Firestore policy validation and user document updates
    // - acceptMultiplePolicies() - requires Firestore batch operations and policy validation
    // - getUserPolicyStatus() - requires Firestore queries and document data processing
    // - checkPolicyCompliance() - requires getUserPolicyStatus and business logic processing
    //
    // Testing these methods without Firebase would require extensive mocking
    // that tests implementation details rather than behavior, providing no
    // real confidence in the code's correctness.
