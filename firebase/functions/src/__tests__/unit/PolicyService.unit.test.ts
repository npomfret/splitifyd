    // All PolicyService methods require Firebase and should be tested
    // in integration tests with the emulator running:
    //
    // - listPolicies() - requires Firestore document queries
    // - getPolicy() - requires Firestore document fetching and validation
    // - getPolicyVersion() - requires Firestore and version lookup
    // - updatePolicy() - requires Firestore, crypto hashing, and versioning
    // - publishPolicy() - requires Firestore updates and validation
    // - createPolicy() - requires Firestore document creation and hashing
    // - deletePolicyVersion() - requires Firestore updates and validation
    //
    // Testing these methods without Firebase would require extensive mocking
    // that tests implementation details rather than behavior, providing no
    // real confidence in the code's correctness.
