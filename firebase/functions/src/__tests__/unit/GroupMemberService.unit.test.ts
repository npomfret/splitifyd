    // All GroupMemberService methods require Firebase and should be tested
    // in integration tests with the emulator running:
    //
    // - getGroupMembersData() - requires Firestore and user profile fetching
    // - getGroupMembers() - requires Firestore document queries and member validation
    // - leaveGroup() - requires Firestore updates, balance calculations, and validation
    // - removeGroupMember() - requires Firestore updates, balance calculations, and permission checks
    //
    // Testing these methods without Firebase would require extensive mocking
    // that tests implementation details rather than behavior, providing no
    // real confidence in the code's correctness.
