    //
    // - generateShareableLink() - requires Firestore transactions and share link creation
    // - previewGroupByLink() - requires Firestore queries and share link validation
    // - joinGroupByLink() - requires Firestore transactions, member updates, and share link processing
    //
    // Testing these methods without Firebase would require extensive mocking
    // that tests implementation details rather than behavior, providing no
    // real confidence in the code's correctness.
