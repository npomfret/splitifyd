    // All ExpenseService methods require Firebase and should be tested
    // in integration tests with the emulator running:
    //
    // - getExpense() - requires Firestore and participant validation
    // - listGroupExpenses() - requires Firestore and permission checking
    // - createExpense() - requires Firestore transactions and balance calculations
    // - updateExpense() - requires Firestore transactions and optimistic locking
    // - deleteExpense() - requires Firestore transactions and permission validation
    //
    // Testing these methods without Firebase would require extensive mocking
    // that tests implementation details rather than behavior, providing no
    // real confidence in the code's correctness.
    //
    // The previous mock-heavy version of this test had 1,262 lines of brittle
    // mock setup that broke on every refactoring. Integration tests provide
    // far better value for testing this service.
